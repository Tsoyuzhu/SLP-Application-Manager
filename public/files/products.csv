As the only one who has chose to study in the field a STEM in my family , I often found  that there is a lack of support and advice. Having recently completed a rewarding exchange and starting my 3rd year of studies, I believe STEM Leaders Program is a PERFECT opportunity for me to galvanise my professional development skills and meet like-minded students and mentors throughout the 5 day program.    ","The increasing importance of soft skills in a corporate environment is one of my motivation to join this program.  As an active LISTENER and a good COMMUNICATOR, I would love to further develop those skills as well as practicing my WRITING, PRESENTATION and NETWORKING skills. The term ""SOFT SKILLS "" is really about increasing our EQ (Emotional Intelligence) by that I mean skills in understanding other's emotions and being able to interpret and manage those emotions in a smart way. ","I consider myself as a TEAM PLAYER. I was enrolled in an Engineering Grand Challenges course – a global education course established by the partnership of the UNSW and ASU. The CHALLENGE of the course was to manage TIME DIFFERENCE as well as balancing DIFFERENT OPINIONS because the members of the team all come from very different backgrounds. As mentioned before, I am active listener and effective communicator so I was able to manage conflicting ideas and our team finally reached a united solution to the problem. Throughout the course, I was also managing the team's meeting minutes and organizing other logistics with presentation and submission . ","When I was on my exchange last year, I was part of a local student led organisation where we worked together to design, organize and lead a cultural games night for local students to understand more about the local culture. 

Being the MC and one of the co-organizers of the night, I was in charge of the night’s run sheet, coordinating with the marketing, finance and event directors. Coming from an international background, I appreciated the individual talents and it was because of such respect for each other, we worked well as a team. 

The event was successful as our ideas reached over 60 students ( which was not large, but great turnout for an MID-SESSION EXAM period )  not only showcasing the local history but also empowering the message of diversity and cultural understanding.

After several years engaging in individual and team based sports and projects, I have found that I am highly driven by the satisfaction of team chemistry and success rather than individual achievement. I enjoy working with others and believe this program is able to immensely enhance my communication and teamwork skills, specific to the STEM sector. My current Distinction WAM is as a result of being able to communicate well in terms of sharing help and regularly participating in group forums, and also being able to remain organised while juggling on-call casual employment, a plethora of weekly sporting activities and university development programs. My developed organisation skills, initiative and time management will aid me in greatly benefiting from such a valuable experience.","The program offers a valuable, collaborative experience for developing, like-minded students to tackle real-life engineering issues. This allows participants to grow in the form of consultation skills, team work cohesion, and technical and leadership ability, growth I would unquestionably would like to undergo. The program not only focuses on formulating solutions that our academic study exposes us to, but also doing so with efficiency in order to mimic real-life practical situations. Furthermore, essentially selling one’s self through personality and professional articulation of ideas and solutions to clients, is something I would like to see myself thoroughly developing through this program. I believe my enthusiasm, positivity and work ethic ensures I am a competent prospect to any team environment and as a result, I do believe I will be able to quickly absorb and apply technical and leadership skills through influential peers, mentors and industry leaders.","During my previous employment, there was a time when the fast-paced restaurant environment had become immensely overwhelming for my co-workers. They were not exhibiting persevering attitudes, leading to degrading team cohesion. Although I was busily carrying out my duties as well as supervising junior staff, I managed to express my judgement that although the customers were the cause of our frantic workplace, they were also our highest priority and the reason for our employment. I expressed that a lacking attitude would cause a bad reputation for the restaurant. The team cohesion increased dramatically due to agreed diligent cooperation and we were able to efficiently carry out tasks whilst exhibiting professional conduct. I believe I have the ability to foresee and execute objectives successfully, despite the presence of daunting obstacles, spreading this influence to my peers and consequently channelling team cohesion.","Whilst I was working on an engineering group project, we were becoming very tight on deadlines. We still had reports to complete and practice run tests to validate our project’s functionality. I had completed my duties within the project, however the other team members were not up to par and had become irritated when I simply questioned them about their progress. I was taken aback by their responses but I chose to remain calm and rational. I knew that time constraints would not possibly allow me to do everyone’s task on their behalf, so I had to focus on channelling team cohesion from my peers. Hence I acknowledged that the deadlines were tight and expressed my understanding for their frantic personal schedules. I then explained again the reasoning and importance behind everyone needing to be on the same page, as there were still final validation tests to run that accounted for a significant portion of our final market. The other members were then able to clarify when they would finish certain tasks by, allowing for a progressive sequence of events to follow through efficiently. This was aided by my willingness to assist the other members in guiding them through their task, ensuring they were equipped with the correct resources, as well as editing their written contributions. As a result of my influential initiation to spur the team on, as well as the returned cooperation and consideration by my peers, we were able to diligently steer ourselves back onto a succeeding path and dramatically boost our team cohesion. We successfully were able to finish before the deadline and run the validation tests. Although our final mark was not as high as we anticipated, it was definitely a much better outcome than if the other members remained unmotivated in achieving their deadlines.","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1smhaO_V7fxn9tyq1T66jAMS2SFkrvJWK/view

Most importantly, I decided to apply for the program after reading about the opportunity to work with industry mentors. Working and communicating with mentors with experience in the field and learning about their work definitely sounds like a great way to gain first-hand insight about where my degree can take me.","In general, I would love to gain the skills that bridge the jump between university and the industry. Through communicating with industry leaders, I think it would be great to learn the soft skills that are still required in the STEM field (e.g. teamwork, presentation). On top of that, I would also like to gain technical skills specific to the field. Learning about the different technical skills and what career paths they can lead to will certainly aid my career development in computer science as it is quite a broad field.","I am quite comfortable with working in a team, especially through my experience working as a part of university societies, group projects, start-ups and event management teams. A big example would be working as a team to meet the deadline of a start-up pitch. I think the key to our success as a team was the first meeting in which we outlined the smaller tasks we needed to get done in order for the bigger project (pitching our start-up idea) to be completed. As we had such limited time, tasks were delegated to people with the experience and skills for it. As the deadline approached though, I think the key to teamwork was my proactiveness to ask how each member was progressing with delegated tasks and helping out if anyone felt overwhelmed. This always worked both ways as well in that I would ask for a bit of help if I needed. Overall, initial organisation, communication and flexibility made our team work well.","My minor experience with demonstrating leadership at a society event while I was in their subcommittee last year impacted positively on me and the people around me. In the morning of the event when we were lacking helpers to organise setting up the event, telling people about the location, meeting the society sponsors for the event, etc, I responded on the spot to message other people if they were available at uni, then gave them a run down of what they needed to do. I think the main part of being an effective leader at this event was managing to check in with every point of the event (setting up location, setting up finger foods, etc) and making sure everyone knew what to do. Part of being a leader here was also getting enough courage to take initiative when needed at such short notice.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5Uah3la0WSlV3c2Q1N5R2UtczQ

He noted that it provided very valuable skills and experiences in a quick amount of time.,"I aim to gain further interpersonal and teamwork skills, specifically those skills when working in an actual workplace-like environment. As of now, I have little experience when working in realistic workplace-like environments as I have only had experience in academic environments instead. ","I believe that I fill a good supportive backbone role when I work in a team. To elaborate, I provide crucial attention to detail that are often missed, form bridges in communication when I see there's a lack of, and give direction if I see the team working aimlessly. This directly stems from my role as the shotcaller in the many online competitive games I've competed in, where I am the voice for the rest of the team providing direct paths to achieve an end goal.","Last year, one of my best friends asked me to aid him and his team as they enter the Oceanic competitive scene for a prominent eSport title, as I have had experience competing. Without any compensation, I took some time out of my university schedules to apply what I've learnt in my past experiences to both: coach the team, identifying key problems in the team dynamics and individual mentalities, and pathways to fix those; as well as managing the team, negotiating the signing of an up-and-coming Australian eSports organisation. The team went from the bottom 6th position on the ladder, to qualifying and attending two LAN (in-person) events held in Melbourne, and then eventually becoming the best team in the region to represent Oceania in the 2018 Smite World Championships held in Atlanta. I am still working with the team today.","https://www.dropbox.com/s/2n1731u5ourl7eo/2018%20Tony%20Tang%20Resume%20STEM%20Leaders.pdf?dl=0

It helps me to gain more exposure to engineering world by getting in touch with industry experts, which leads to better understanding of the industry. From mentoring program to working on projects, it is impossible that we can get those knowledge from our lectures. So I feel this opportunity to gain and hands on experience and apply my knowledge that i have learned so far from real life situation. ","I hope that this program will allow me to showcase my potential and contribute to workable learning process. From this, I hope to learn how to take initiative and responsibility in terms of managing each projects. I believed this will also teach me a lot about time management and develop my confidence in presenting my ideas to others. Being in the engineering industry, I feel that these are very important skills that will come in use my future career. Furthermore, I hope that I will learn communication skills by collaborating with others in this project.  ","As an unibuds executive committee for the past 2 years, I have truly gained lots of experiences in teamwork, communication and leadership. I work well under pressure and it is proved by how successful the events I organised are. My team consider me as a good team player and able to adapt to changes. I also gave lots of support to my fellow committee members. Back in 2017 Bodhi Nite at Science Theatre, my team and I managed to organise the lighting and sound system for the whole event. We only had 5 weeks of preparation to organise a 4 hours performances night in which we were able to pull that off successfully. ","My outgoing personality had allowed me to gather enough manpower for the past events I have organised during my time in UNIBUDS. I am really confident in my persuasion and communication skills in which both have significant role in my leadership skill development. I have showed my leadership skill in my past role as a Sports Director in UNIBUDS in which I organised weekly sports session. In each sports session, I successfully delegated tasks to my subcommittee and engaged members at the same time. Additionally, my team and I have organised two major events in 2017 in which I headed a department by myself. I led my assistant and helpers in executing their tasks and guide them through the preparation and event day. I am happy to say that the event was successful and my team was satisfied with what we achieved. Moreover, internally, I have always    strived to be a better individual, including my leadership skill. Having all these experiences in working in an organisation and my internal motivation, I believe that I have the ability to be a leader for the future, which coincides with the aim of STEM Leaders Program.

I would be able to utilised all the knowledge I have learnt throughout my Chemical Engineering degree and apply it to create a practical solution. Furthermore, the program will not only expose me to projects but will allow for professional development and a chance to expand my networks and learn from industry professionals within their respective fields. ","I wish to gain the technical skills which are required to successfully design and execute a strategy within a STEM project. This would be essential in aiding my career development as I am currently lacking the experience of applying theoretical concepts to actual solutions. After completing the program, I believe I will have a much clearer understanding of what I need to improve on technically in order to be successful within my chosen field. ",I have been involved in a study aboard program in Vietnam where I was working within a group of 3. The objective of the program was to design our own project that would target one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The project we created was successful and we were able to achieve a great mark.

I always remain objectives whist working within a team and don’t let my emotions cloud my judgement on different possible solutions.,"I have demonstrated through my extracurricular activities and previous work experiences that I have strong team orientation, leadership and communication skills. These skills are evident in my experience as a Mentor for the UNSW Engineering Mentoring Program where I help ease the transition from high school to university for first year engineering students by providing academic and extracurricular guidance. I demonstrated great leadership skills within this role by effectively communicating with the mentees and ensuring that I provided thoughtful advice that would benefit their university goals.

I always finish the task that I am given by the team leader on time, and provide assistance to my group members. Rather than complain about my group member not contributing to the project, I would discuss it with the team leader and would end up splitting the load with the team leader.

I believe this program will prepare me for when I enter the workforce by not only strengthening the leaderships skills I already have, but also teaching me leaderships skills that I have not yet explored.

Also, I believe the STEM Leaders program would enhance my ability to work along with my peers. I understand that it is critical to know how to interact with those surrounding you when it comes to any sort of project, and such is why I believe learning such skills is invaluable.

Furthermore, I thoroughly appreciate having the opportunity to be surrounded by those with industrial experiences outside the classroom, as their knowledge gives me insight to what it is like to be a part of the workforce, as well as inspire me further in becoming a Civil Engineer.","On completion of the STEM Leaders Program, I would like to ultimately improve my professional skills. I personally believe that not many people possess high levels of professional skills, which are critical when it comes to the STEM industry. 

Most importantly, I would like to further learn how to become an ideal leader. I personally believe that being a good leader is one who is able engage with others, whilst efficiently working towards the goal of any project. Leaders have the ability to assess and learn from any situation, and that is a skill I believe is important to have when I finally enter the industry. If you can be a good leader, you can be a good learner, and I believe you can never stop learning.

Furthermore, I would like to learn how to define and refine myself when it comes to self-branding. I want to learn the ways to best show my skills, knowledge and assets to others, whether they be peers or potential employers.","Throughout my degree as an undergraduate Civil Engineer, working as a part of a team has always been embedded within our learning. It has been taught to us from the very first day that it is always better to work as a team than by one self, especially in a dynamic environment as expected in the STEM industry.

I believe that I work very well in team environments, as I thoroughly enjoy the interactions that come with team-based projects. I enjoy the vast differences in perspectives that ultimately leads to a refined objective once the project is complete.

I am currently working alongside a 4-man team as a part of my fourth year Thesis course. My ability to engage and understand all peers within the team makes me believe that I am a valuable team member. I use my knowledge, and ability to assess situations to give my input on important matters that we may be facing as a group. I appreciate that my team receives my opinion with regard, and it is something I reciprocate.","Without a doubt, I don’t fully have what it takes to be a great leader as I still have a lot to learn. However, there have been several times where I have been given the opportunity to demonstrate my leadership skills. I had previously taken the responsibility as team captain in several games of team sports, allowing me to demonstrate my ability to communicate and delegate tasks with my team mates. 

The most recent memory of myself taking full leadership was when I volunteered as a crew member at the CeBIT 2016 Exhibit, which is the largest Business Technology Conference & Exhibition in Pacific Asia which involved over tens of thousands of patrons. I was given the opportunity to lead a group of 4 other volunteers, which involved delegating tasks and offering help to any difficulties that arose throughout the day. I was able to maintain composure throughout the day and was able to assess and process the dynamic that I was surrounded by.

My most recent experience of good leadership was at my previous job at Fuji Xerox back in 2017. The leadership that I had witnessed were from the senior staff that were present, who had to manage over 150 staff every day. I witnessed them taking control of all problems that arose, and their ability to give personal assistance had any of my peers required any help was admirable. I realized that leadership was not run by single persons, but rather were a group of people that work jointly to maximize efficiency and find solutions to any problems effectively.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A9t_hI9j2mfz_IM1GMiDiEQqNCFZ2XsJ/view?usp=sharing

I also dont know anything about LinkedIn. I'd like to gain a better proficiency in presenting ideas effectively through presentations and also get better at resume's.","As Vice-Captain of my school, I participated as part of the prefect body to raise money for the Cambodian Childrens Charity. CCC was the school’s charity, with my school, Kinross Wolaroi, sponsoring a grade to move from kindergarten to Yr 12. We needed to raise $10,000 to support Year Kinross during our year of responsibility. Over the year we organised sausage sizzles, movie nights and other fundraising events, utilising our groups contacts to get cheap meat and widespread advertisement to reduce costs and maximise funds. Our largest event was the annual CCC movie night, in which we organised the making of over 200 cup cakes, 400 lolly bags, lots of sausages and cans of drink, selling all the tickets, the outdoor blow up screen and manning the canteen to serve food through out the night. The year was a huge success, with Kinross raising more than the amount it needed, allowing CCC to begin work on a small library.","During my schooling I was part of the cadet program, going on many camps and achieving Echo Company Commander in my final year. On Bivouac in 2017, we had a cadet trip over on a trek and bang his head. I assessed him and thought he was concussed. However, it was also starting to get dark and the rest of the company needed to be at nightloc before sunset to set up their hootchi's and cook meals. As the lead rank of the company, I and my fellow CUO’s devised a way to utilise each member of ranks different skills in man management, motivation, navigation and workmanship to ensure that the company got to the nightloc in time to set up their hootchi’s before it got dark and behaved at the night harbour, ensure that the injured cadet got to a road quickly and safely to get assessed by the doctor and medevac’d back to base camp, and ensure that from their the rank got safely to the nightloc and had somewhere to sleep and food to eat. We devised that the strongest of us would carry the cadet the few kilometres to the road while the 2IC of the company, accompanied by the corporals would a couple of sergeants would take the cadets to the nightloc, explain the situation to the teachers there, and set up a large group hootchi for the cadet-carrying rank. The plan came off without a hitch, the injured cadet was kept under observation that night at base camp and morale was kept high throughout the night.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/i1vwt35949g7qc0/V3_Will%20CV%202017.docx?dl=0

During the planning phase, a week before the session, we worked collaboratively to research and compile a list of appropriate topics to talk about and create a contingency plan for the session. Eighteen students arrived for one of the discussion group sessions, more than we expected. From our contingency plan, since there were three Project Officers and three International Student Ambassadors at the time, we decided to split up into three smaller groups of 6 students and arranged in a circle seating arrangement. From this, the students were able to speak out more often without feeling discouraged and were satisfied with smaller discussion groups.","I was an engineering peer mentor at UNSW, providing help and guidance to two  first-year undergraduate students by keeping in regular contact by Email and Facebook. I organised every weekly mentor meeting sessions by compiling a list of topics to discuss before each mentor meeting. In weekly mentor meetings, I discussed a range of topics with them to ensure they better understand the life at UNSW. This included:
- Giving a campus tour of their timetabled classes and food courts to build their 
  familiarity with the campus environment
- UNSW services, including Careers and Employment and Student Central
- Moodle, myUNSW, course outlines
- Lectures, tutorials, laboratory work
- Study tips
- Getting involved in societies, sports, and other activities   
- Meeting new people
- Industrial training 

In addition to the mentor meetings, I responded to the questions from my mentees through Email, such as whether they need to use a textbook for a particular course. I aimed to keep in regular contact with them to ensure that they are comfortable to ask for help when needed. 

I was able to get my mentees to navigate around UNSW comfortably after several mentoring sessions. They developed a better understanding of university life and services, including where to find specific course information and accessing the university's Careers and Employment services. I inspired the mentees to look for professional development opportunities including volunteering that they were not aware of and were able to prepare them for university life, both academically and socially.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/lcwnysvwny99yon/Resume%20-%20Raymond%20C.docx?dl=0

4/12/2018 0:08:56,Ga Jung Lee,gajunglee@gmail.com,425341887,4,UNSW,"Bachelor of Engineering, Civil",Civil Engineering,Friend,"I decided to apply for the STEM leaders Program as I heard it allowed for the opportunity to develop transferable, employability skills such as teamwork, leadership and creative problem solving. 
During my time at university I did not have many chances to develop these skills effectively and they have thus remained stagnant and relatively undeveloped. I see the STEM Leaders Program as a solution to this dilemma I have.
I wish to specifically focus on developing my public speaking and leadership skills as I find those to be the skills that I am relatively weak in.
Also, it is my final year in university so it is my last opportunity to develop these critical skills before graduation.
I am extremely excited to develop these skills by working with a team to solve difficult industry related problems and the fact that these problems are sourced directly from a private company spurs my desire to perform well even more.","I have always had a debilitating fear of public speaking and always had trouble presenting in front of people. I would become extremely nervous, sweat profusely, and stutter uncontrollably that it would be a very sad sight to witness. From completing the program, I would like to overcome this weakness and transform it into a strength through exposure therapy. By forcing myself to undergo similar situations repeatedly, I hope to metamorphosize and perfect my ability to present to a large audience. As presenting to a group is an integral skill required in the professional field and for effective communication in general, I believe overcoming this weakness will be of immeasurable value in my career 
 and personal development.
I also need to develop my problem solving skills as I believe they can only be developed through experience. From creating solutions to real industry problems, I hope to improve my ability to formulate solutions and also just experience and confront the relevant problems faced in the Engineering industry.","I perform very well in a team as I facilitate effective communication by practicing radical open mindedness and focusing on the facts and not allowing emotion to colour the discourse.
During a group project for the course CVEN3031 Civil Engineering Practice, a series of real world problems were given which were to be solved as a group. During this course, there were many heated discussions due to the conflict of opinions regarding the solution to be implemented. Whenever such situations arose I was able to perform well as part of a team by always striving to facilitate efficient communication. Despite the pressure and stress from an impending due date, I focused on keeping the arguments and discussions logical and free from emotional baggage. I acted as a mediator between more aggressive members and I tried to practice radical open-mindedness to better understand the other person and their point of view. This allowed for effective communication to occur.
","During 2017 I worked part time as a waiter at a restaurant. One of the days I went to work and due to a mistake in the roster there was no manager and anyone in a leadership role to lead the hall staff. Because of this, there was chaos in the serving area as the other waiters clashed into each other due to a lack of management and control. Orders were getting mixed up, the narrow passageways were being clogged up by the waiters' routes intersecting each others. It was utter chaos.
The vacuum in leadership pushed me to stand up and take control of the situation as I had relatively more experience compared to the other waiters. This was done by directing the other waiters to specific areas for them to work in, delegating more responsibility to those who had more experience and guiding the less experienced waiters on what they needed to do. Thus, I was able to restore order to an otherwise chaotic dining area.
By the end of the day, once the management realised the error they made, they congratulated me for taking responsibility and demonstrating leadership in that situation. I was promoted to the position of head waiter some time later.
This experience positively impacted me as I have tended to play a passive role in my affairs and I guess in my life. I rarely stepped up to take an active role and this has been a cause of a great number of missed opportunities. By proactively taking responsibility, I demonstrated to myself that I had the capacity to make a change and an impact to my environment and myself. This incident sparked a paradigm shift in the way I approached life and I began to take more initiative in all aspects of my life.

After being told how great the program is and looking through the brief introduction of the program, I'm really impressed by the 'workshop experience' provided by the program. As an engineering student, technical skills are no doubt important, but meanwhile improving one's soft skills and practical skills can be also vital. Besides, I believe I can network with lots of talented engineering students and industry people through the program. I believe it's a really precious opportunity and I'm finger crossed for being allowed in the position.","I hope that I can know more about how to put what I learn in uni into practice.

Corresponding to one of the group projects done last semester, the course coordinator gave us group members' emails and asked us to do a project. The course was a little bit unorganized. So I sent the email to all the students and added them on Facebook to chat.

I decided to apply to gain an insight on industry and real practical experience that I have never been exposed to before. Even if the industries are not very related to my field of study, I am still interested in learning about them and diversifying my knowledge and experiences. I also decided to apply to learn more about professional skills that are useful in the workplace, and to attempt implementing workplace skills I have previously learnt from similar workshops. I also applied in order to network with students and industry representatives from other fields and to discover the rest of STEM which I have not been very exposed to, the 'TEM' side, as mentioned previously. ","Firstly, I would like to develop my critical thinking skills. In order to thoroughly think critically, I believe it is necessary to view and learn about the different thought and problem solving processes of others in order to learn and recognise how one thinks and how one can improve upon their own thinking. Through this program, I believe I will be exposed to an array of critical thinking and problem solving styles, especially since I would be collaborating with others from different STEM areas (TEM students) who would most likely deconstruct problems in a different manner than I would. I would also like to develop my networking skills and how I approach and maintain connections with others. Networking is an essential skill required across any industry, and I would love to put what I know about it into practice whilst improving upon it. ","I tend to work collaboratively when in teams with the goal of completing tasks in a realistic and conflict free manner. For example, in an assignment group for a management course, there was a lot of team conflict regarding our assignment. Members of the team continued to disagree on several aspects of it to the extent where the deadline was less than a week away and we had not prepared anything. I decided to speak to each team member individually (especially those who severely disagreed with one another), offering them a compromised solution to their issue as a recommendation (how they should compromise when coming to decisions as a group and that an individual won't be able to dominate over other people's decisions). Then, the team members did in fact reconcile and we worked as hard as we could to meet the deadline with more open communication and consideration to each others' skills and insights.  ","Leadership is something I am very passionate about. I believe that everyone is a leader in their own way without carrying the title of one. I have learnt about leadership through workshops and by having leadership positions. For example, as Co-founder and co-president of the UNSW Middle Eastern Food and Culture Society, I encountered a lot of times where my leadership skills were tested. On several occasions, some of the executive team members were evidently  uncertain about tasks they were required to do and for some reason hesitated to ask me. I did identify their hesitation and provided them with clarification and guidance and informed of how I am always there to assist them. I have also observed leadership around me on several occasions. One example that positively impacted me and others around me occurred when I was in Cairo. There was an elderly woman attempting to enter the bank which via a crowded steep staircase which I was exiting through. A man saw her struggling and offered to provide her guidance. He took action and told others to please move and make way for her. This is an example of how leadership is also about assisting those around you and stepping up in any context to take action. This scene really inspired me to become a better leader in  my daily life. Another example of leadership that positively impacted me is my manager at work. He demonstrates how leadership is in fact about positively guiding others. When someone is late or makes a major error at work he does not get angry and implement consequences. He takes us to the side, asks us what is wrong and gives us feedback on how to improve. His leadership creates a really nice work environment.","www.linkedin.com/in/shahd-hassabalnaby-3b5a2913a

The opportunity to work on an engineering projects under the guidance of a mentor will provide a valuable insight into how engineering workplaces function in the real world. As someone who doesn’t feel professionally ready, I look forward to the intensive skill-building and self-marketing (LinkedIn/resume etc.) workshops within the program.  Being able to network with, and gain feedback from industry mentors and RSE members will provide a level of guidance that I haven’t received so far. The opportunity to score an internship is also very attractive, and hopefully this will be the case. 
","I would like to improve my presentation, interview and leadership skills the most, amongst others. 

I hope to improve my presentation skills as will help me positively market myself, the team and the workplace. Good presentation skills are universally needed in all industries, and I look forward having the opportunity to improve them during this program. Observing the presentations of industry representatives and workshop hosts, and hopefully having a chance to practice the presentation skills I’ve learnt will be incredibly beneficial. 

Through the professional development workshops, I look forward to improving my interview skills. Interviews are possibly the most important stage of the recruitment process, and I look forward to learning tips and tricks on how to do well in them. 

 “Leadership” is an important skill emphasised by some of my favourite companies. Learning about leadership from industry partners and workshops will therefore be quite valuable. 
","As a telephonist and receptionist at Sutherland Hospital, I believe I work well with colleagues in dealing with unexpected security threats. There was an instance where a patient suddenly approached me, demanding to be discharged to a different hospital. I calmly explained to her that this was not possible, whilst subtly gesturing my colleague to call security. The patient grew more aggressive, so I decided to keep her distracted by slowly writing down her demands until the security officers arrived. Good communication and quick-thinking between my teammate and I ensured that the situation didn’t escalate further. ","At my workplace, Sutherland Hospital, old batteries were simply thrown into the regular bin. This was not ideal due to the detrimental impact of batteries in landfill. I simply put out a labelled container, and asked my bosses asking if it was okay for all old batteries be placed into it instead - to which they agreed. Once full, I took the batteries and disposed of them at the local, battery-specific, bin at Aldi. It has been more than a year since this has occurred, and I have lost count of the number of batteries diverted away from landfill.  This experience has taught me that it’s possible to engage in leadership with the simplest of actions, given that you take most of the responsibility and make it easy for others.  

One of my good friends is president of a busy society, maintains an excellent academic record also manages take care of himself by going to the gym regularly.  His method of “leading-by-example” is quite inspiring to me. By ensuring that he works harder than the level of work he expects from his team, they are more than happy to back him up with support, to strengthen the society.  For example, his society was able to secure an industry sponsorship from Cochlear and were able to score numerous industry partner visits to an Industrial Training evening earlier this year.

To achieve both tasks, I practised being able to actively listen and being able to do this in both of these courses has honed my ability to work successfully with others.  ","In another previous course we had an assessment which required us to interview a lecturer on their research field and write an essay on their research. The groups were randomly assigned, and my group had an international student who had difficulties in writing in depth in English and as a result would struggle in this assessment. I realised that he would need some help in submitting his part of the assessment, so I finished my part early and encouraged him to send me his work so that I could annotate and give him advice. As a result of doing this he was encouraged to work harder and has since improved in his writing abilities and communicated more with the group to complete the assessment.

These skills however are quite important when considering entering the workforce as well as finding an internship, thus I hope that I will be given an opportunity to further improve on these skills. Additionally I look forwards to gaining more knowledge about my field of study. Although my subjects are related to bioinformatics and biomedical engineering, I still feel that I lack insight into the work environments of these fields. However I hope that by participating in STEM, that I can further develop my insight and plan ahead on where I wish to pursue my career. ","As a result of working within multidisciplinary teams, I’ve found that I work well as a team player, taking the initiative to fill in any particular role when necessary. The most recent experience I gained was in the UNSW subject ENGG1000, where by I selected the biomedical stream - given the task of composing a bionic elbow using nitinol springs, alongside an exceptional team. Although at various times, other members were slacking off, I found that in encouraging communication and building a comfortable team environment, we found our rhythm as a team.

","My highschool was given an opportunity to participate in the FIRST FRC Robotics competition - under the sponsorship of Macquarie University. Essentially when the team began, due to few members, I was assigned into the software team with a peer as the leader. However over the course of the semester, my fellow teammate found it harder to manage the team successfully, and our mentor asked if I could fill in the role when she left. Although I initially didn't see myself fitting the role,  once I began managing progress and assisting other members with programming, I found that it came more so naturally. Additionally, I found that in being more authoritative when assigning tasks and deadlines, my fellow team members worked more efficiently to meet the time requirements of the project. During this experience not only did I improve on my interpersonal skills but also my leadership skills by learning to manage various personalities, and open a channel of communication to resolve conflicts. 
Personally this experience shaped a number of skills deemed necessary in the future and was quite a positive experience for me. Considering the team, in collaborating well as a team, we were able to complete our tasks to high standard and managed to land 2nd runner up while in competition with other highschools and universities.

If considered, I will gain a thorough understanding of the workings of the engineering industry and be able to contribute significantly to the development of mechanical based companies.","The STEM leaders program focuses on developing essential soft skills and professional skills through its workshops. Among these, communication (such as listening and speaking skills), problem solving, and teamwork skills are vital for a mechanical engineer due to the prominence of group orientated projects in the workplace. These skills are crucial to not only understand individuals but to also collaborate and perform well in a team. Acquiring these soft skills permit me to thrive in an interpersonal space and help build positive relationships with colleagues. Cultivating professional skills such as time management and leadership enable a more efficient allocation of resources as well as improving cohesiveness in team-based environment. These leadership qualities will provide decisiveness and inspire motivation within teams, resulting in an increase in performance. Additionally, improvement in my presentation skills will allow me to better organise and convey my ideas in a concise manner. ","Teamwork is one of the most critical skills to my development as an engineer due to the emphasis on group-based tasks especially in design and manufacturing. Recently, I volunteered during Starlight Day with my friend and we were tasked to sell an assortment of merchandise to the public to raise awareness. We initially did not know the best approach to sell the items and faced difficulties to gather attention. I urged that we experiment different methods of drawing awareness and to pick the one that sold the most items in one hour. We found that ‘setting up shop’ in an intersection to be the most efficient method of approaching the public and would also allow us to rest. Due to my critical thinking, initiative to grab attention through a variety of flashy ways as well as communication to secure the donations, we successfully managed to raise $250 for charity.","Leadership in the professional workplace refers to the motivation of others to excel and the ability to make them develop and grow as people. During my part time work at Code Camp, I was assigned as the head teacher of a class while my co-head teacher, who was inexperienced, had to teach another class on her own. She was unwilling to teach her class, so I had to quickly formulate a solution to allow both classes to be taught without one falling behind the other. In addition, she was lacking in her spoken English, which resulted in her not being able to convey lessons appropriately. As the more experienced head teacher, I was responsible for the education of the students. Therefore, I suggested that we remove the dividing wall between the two classes so that I may teach all students at the same time whilst also allowing my co-head teacher to observe and learn my way of teaching. Instead of completely taking over all the lessons that had to be taught to the class, I encouraged my co-worker to initially assist in teaching certain aspects of a lesson that she was comfortable with, slowly taking over more lessons until the conclusion of the camp. Due to my quick thinking and initiative, we were able to successfully teach the class all required lessons within the limited 3-day duration of the camp. In addition, my approach led to a significant development of my co-worker who was initially incapable of teaching due to her inexperience, but towards the end, became more familiarised with the way I taught and could replicate it on her own. Not only were the students satisfied, but my co-worker gained a significant amount of confidence and competence to teach as a head teacher in the future.

I believe the STEM Leaders program provides me with the opportunity to apply my knowledge to a field I am interested in. I believe this experience will benefit my learning immensely so I wish to apply for this program.

Additionally, I would like to use this opportunity to challenge myself and emerge as a better engineer. ","Through this program, I hope to gain insight to designing energy storage, solar array and wind energy converters.  These fields hold immense potential and I believe understanding them will be beneficial to my professional developement. Additionally, I would like to learn design programs such as Altium and AutoCad as these programs will assist me with design in my professional career.","To me, a team player is an individual who recognises the strength and weaknesses of their colleagues and supports their team in a way to bring out the strength of each member and ultimately lead the team to sucess. 

In a team environment I endeavour to understand and support my colleagues through extensive communication. During my time at Sunswift (student lead project), I volunteered to assist my colleagues in their individual subsystem projects. For example I was able to help a colleague better design his solar array simulation by taking time to explain how a solar cell operated and what a bypass diode does. Through these interaction, I was able to support my colleague so that they where able to increase their work efficiency and quality. ","I aspire to establish a team environment where everyone can openly communicate with other regarding their design ideas. However  the introduction of new idea leads to conflict of interest which can destroy a team. In the past, I had a situation where my colleagues have introduced different approaches to an issue and conseqently argued over each other to promote their idea. In situations like this, I take the lead to first calm both parties down. Then I proceed to list down the advantages, disadvantages of the solution. Finally, I work with both parties to come up with a solution that incorporates the unique advantages of both design. Through this, I minimise the risk of conflict in the team and encourage everyone to work together to ultimately achieve success for the team ",https://docs.google.com/file/d/1X9pmxfL9BgYLowCm6Gg79VbScIXuJBxc/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword

Moreover, the opportunity to collaborate among industry leading firms while developing my professional skills is a great opportunity that I would like to grasp hold of. 

Also, the opportunity to collaborate on a project and have a chance to implement, within a workplace environment, the skills I have learnt within the university is an exciting thought. The opportunity to generate potentially tangible results in a short project is enticing and, as such the STEM Leaders Program is a perfect fit and experience for me. ","During the five day program, I would like to gain professional development skills which can aid me with my career development. In particular, I would like to develop my personal branding and network in order to 'get my name out there'. I believe an environment such as this would be the perfect place to enhance the current skills I have and learn from those who have already traversed the path I am taking. 
Moreover, I believe that this program would be beneficial in meeting like-minded individuals and professionals who could impart wisdom on a fresh first year university student as myself. I would like to have the opportunity to collaborate on a project with these people and gain the necessary communication and presentation skills to progress my skills within my technical field.","I am someone who has no problem working as part of a team, either as a leader or a follower. I believe this is due to, not only my communication skills, but also my attentiveness to others. 
An example of this is when myself and 39 other like-minded individuals organised a charity event to gain donations from the public and our communities. The aim of this was to get enough goods and monetary donations to help those less fortunate than ourselves. As someone on the marketing team of the project, I found it increasingly easier to communicate with my team and the public as we rose to promote our event. 
As such, I believe that this experience would allow me to enhance the skills I learnt from my past project and also allow me to demonstrate my performance as a member of a  team. ","In my final years of high school I was part of the leadership committee for my school's waterpolo team. Being elected into the role was a large responsibility for me and as such I found myself taking on more and more leadership roles, stemming from directing my team but also attracting new members into the club. 

A particular case that comes to mind was the open night of my high school. This is a time for future students to visit the school grounds and experience 'high school' life. As such, this a great opportunity for all the clubs to generate buzz and attract new members. 

Not only did I spend the night providing information to younger students and creating relationships with the potential team members in order to entice their interest and promote the water polo team but also I took  the initiative to organise current team members into a rotational roster. 

As a direct result of our promotional activity, we saw one of the largest influxes of new water polo participants during my time at the school. I believe this reflects my leadership skills and demonstrates how it positively impacted both the team, as a large community means more networking, but also the new student members who got to learn a new skill and experience something they never had before.

This is the first I've heard of such an organised program intended to benefit the employability of university students and this is what I've been looking for. In terms of professional skills, I believe there is still a lot of room for improvement and there are skills I'd like to really work on. Having prepared my resume, coverletter and LinkedIn profile for a few years now, it'd be interesting to having them critiqued by experienced professionals or even another set of eyes seeing it in another perspective. I'm willing to listen to new ideas/ advice and implementing them into my work to grow both personally and professionally. I've heard great things about previous program sessions, and I'd love to part of this amazing program. ","Communicating in a professional manner is something I struggle with. I'm not excellent in professional settings where I'm selected to do interviews or present in front of many people. I believe this is something I can overcome with some practice and advice from experienced people. I am very open to any suggestions, tips & tricks or any techniques that I can use to effectively present and convey my point across in both presentation and interviews. ","As a team member, I am more of a listener rather an a speaker. However, when something important needs to be fixed/ mentioned; I will speak my mind and make sure that problem is addressed. I believe I do work well as a team. I meet deadlines, communicate and initiate creative ideas to help improve the project at hand and most importantly, make sure everyone in the team feels included and useful to the team. As part of a Robogals executive member, there are certain deadlines we have to meet and multiple projects running at once. Aside from constantly multitasking and communicating with other members to complete them successfully, I also work with industry representatives to find ways to get involved and to organise events. In just 12 months, I was able to sign with 7 sponsors whilst maintaining a professional relationship with them and gather a large sum of money to keep our club going.","As a partnerships manager, I found a flaw in the current process of signing up with partners. The problem was maintaining communication with partners and ensuring they stayed up to date with what we're doing. To maintain professionalism whilst being creative, I came up with the idea of a newsletter. In doing so, I gathered the marketing team and met with them to organise potential content and interesting articles we could add to the newsletter whilst keeping it short and succinct. As a leader of this newly project I initiated, I was responsible for the design, format and content that has to be in the newsletter. We tried our best attempt in being creative with the usual ""newsletter"", we constantly met up and listened to each other;s input about what can be included and created many lists about potential subjects. It was not your ordinary newsletter, this was specially targeted towards industry sponsors. In the end, with consistent meeting sessions, long hours of formatting and editing and long discussions about ""potentials"". We came up with a unique design of having a large girl count (number of girls we reached) to enable sponsors to see the progress we are making with their support, an ""expenses"" section where they're able to see where their support went towards and a featured article area where they can read interesting stories from the internal team and the children themselves. During the first release, I received many compliments and encouragement from our sponsors which I shared with my team where they felt a sense of usefulness to the team and their efforts were recognised. From the initial reaction from sponsors, my team and I are now preparing for our third release and we are constantly looking for ways to improve and creatively write our articles.

I am constantly seeking experiences that push me out of my comfort zone, because when I do this I feel like I grow the most. 
The aspect that appeals most to me about the program is the chance to work with a real organisation on a real-life project. Studying Information Systems has given me a solid theoretical foundation of database design, product development, UX design, and Java programming. However, what has been lacking is practical application. I believe working on a challenging project in a short-term intensive and risk-free environment will aid in assessing whether what I see as a potential career is actually something I want to do, and also give me a better understanding of my capabilities as a graduate next year. "," My degree has given me a high-level understanding of concepts mentioned previously, but I am looking to further develop technical skills, particularly in the context of database design, maintenance and Java. 

I see a large part of a potential career as solving a problem and having the ability to accurately transfer information / solutions to clients. I think the presentation night will give me an invaluable opportunity to practice this. 

Also, I think the program can only be beneficial in terms of developing key soft skills such as communication,  problem solving, presentation skills and how to work with different people.","The most recent experience I have had working as part of a team in a problem-solution oriented task was UNSW Heroes. This program involved developing a prototype aimed at improving the student experience at UNSW. Our solution aimed to enhance existing group assignment framework to help students work more effectively as part of a team.
Individually, I felt I worked quite well as part of the team. I took an inquisitive approach to the problem identification process, asking many questions of others' ideas. This helped the group to better understand the problem at hand. 
I then designed the UI, continuously liaising with the team to ensure our prototype met the needs of students.
I then worked with the team to construct a pitch that communicated our idea enthusiastically,finally pitching this idea to a panel of judges. I felt the project was successful, placing fourth on the pitch night.","The most memorable project I have worked on at University was the development of a small-scale enterprise system. I quickly assumed the role of the leader in the group. I was keen to get the project started. 
In the first meeting, the group read through the task and assessed who would take on which role (i.e doing internal and external research, developing the UI, constructing and maintaining the back-end etc.)
I was lucky to have a team with a diverse range of abilities, so I asked each team member to identify which task they felt most comfortable doing. I also asked them what they believed their strengths were and suggested tasks I felt they were capable of completing, without being dictatorial. This action was crucial and increased the productivity of the group, with a large portion of the work being complete two weeks prior to the deadline. It was also about ensuring that each team member had a sufficient appetite for the work they were competing, as much as it was about productivity. 

At times, there were situations where individuals were not contributing as much as the group required. At these times, I sought to help out as much as possible, as well as ask why they were not contributing. I believe leadership is also about having the ability to empathize with others, encourage them and approach problems in a positive manner.  

I continued this leadership position for the duration of the project. The group achieved an outcome that they were all proud of, and most importantly the group have kept in touch with each other. 
I believe this experience helped me to develop many leadership skills, mostly interpersonal skills, task delegation and conflict resolution. ","Would love to get feedback on my LinkedIn profile, as well as resume:

The program also offers the opportunity to collaborate alongside industry firms to gain experience through a real project while also allowing for a platform to promote myself in front of potential employers. Moreover, the program also will help me develop a variety of professional skills such as, resume writing and LinkedIn branding while simultaneously polishing off areas such as presentation skills. As a computer science student, the coding workshops being offered is also another reason I have decided to apply. Gaining knowledge about development is invaluable and Real Skills Education has also placed emphasis on its dedication to teach these skills.","The ability to code is a highly sought after and as a result is one of the most in-demand skills by employers today and as a computer science student, the need to be able to code in a variety of languages is important. The STEM Leaders program will provide me with the opportunity to dip my feet into basic development as well as put my skills in coding into practice through the workshops offered. As such, I aim to gain experience in a real project through this program allowing me to stand out from my fellow peers. Furthermore, I am aiming to learn professional skills such as resume writing, LinkedIn branding and networking. These are skills that I have not fully developed but would require as I consider them to be vital in setting myself apart.","I believe that I perform extremely well as part of a team. This is evidenced during my ENGG1000 project where we were tasked with designing, constructing and testing a model compact vehicle that would travel over simulated rough terrain while transporting a payload. As a team we decided to split the design into separate teams of electrical, mechanical and computing. This resulted in a significant amount of communication required between the teams, particularly from myself, as I was the sole person in charge of the electrical circuitry and had to work with mechanical team for locations to place components as well as computing team for what they would require. Furthermore, this project required a lot of time management skills with various other tasks due at different points in semester. Overall, this team functioned extremely well becoming the highest scores for the engineering and innovation section as well as highest overall score.","At the end of my high school education, I had decided that I wanted to involve myself in more activities while also maintaining contact with my friends. In order to do this I decided to start our own soccer team in a local league. This involved a lot of preparation, finding the correct team to join based on fees and location, finding available players, communicating between our players and the management team at the local club and organising for items such as jerseys, shorts and balls. As the leader and founder of this group, I also needed to have a strong influence over team members, motivating each player to aspire to be their best while also performing managerial tasks such as informing them of upcoming game times and training sessions. I quickly realised that by complimenting and signifying what each player was doing, regardless of how small, the morale and enthusiasm of the team lifted sharply as each member achieved a sense of pride in what they were doing. This resulted in the team atmosphere and team spirit being in great shape and despite match results initially not being in our favour, members consistently turned up to both training and games.  Furthermore, as time passed, other members were willing to have input into the team with another member taking over the captaincy role allowing me to purely focus on managerial tasks while we both worked on coaching the team. With this new setup moving forward we were able to effectively lead and manage the team with results gradually improving throughout the season.

I would thoroughly appreciate the opportunity to work with peers at a similar stage of their degree/careers as we discover and navigate the world of STEM internships and opportunities. The potential offered by the STEM Leaders Program for professional development is too promising to not get involved with. ",I would specifically benefit from getting advice and direction when it comes to personal branding. This includes my LinkedIn and written inquires for internships and career opportunities. It will also be a great chance to improve and build on my networking skills. ,"I thrive in a team environment, enjoying the chance to bounce ideas of my peers and find support to overcome challenges we face as we work towards a common goal. An example of this was my recent participation in the UNSWOT Summer of StartUps, hosted at UNSW over this past summer, where my group created and developed educational robot kits for young children. I was away for part of the process, due to an internship in Brisbane, but was still able to contribute daily to our team and join in meetings where I could. I found that this highlighted my will to be an active team member, with my role in facilitating team discussion and collaboration being strengthened. There were many challenges thrown at us during this process and, after we had taken the project to fruition, my teammates praised me on my ability to stay positive throughout and encourage the group to think of solutions rather than stress over the ""what ifs"".  ","One of my most memorable leadership moments was during my Gold Duke of Edinburgh, where three other girls and I managed to go off track on our qualifying hike and get lost. Despite having run out of water and being stuck in thick bush scrub I realised it was important that I stayed positive and gave the others strength. I delegated roles to two of the girls (including navigating and radio calls) while making sure I was guiding and encouraging the third girl, who had broken her arm. I kept up good humoured conversation and made sure we were all being honest with each other about our limits and frustrations. With their help and support we managed to find our way back to a creek that led us to the path. Although at the end it was acknowledged that by stepping up and taking lead I was the reason we got out of that situation, to this day I still believe I wouldn't have been able to find strength and confidence without their positive reactions and willingness to contribute. In this way, I believe not only did I find aspects of leadership in myself, I learnt about the different ways leadership can present itself in others. 

This experience of taking charge of a group in hardship, and leading us through collaboration to success is something I draw on today in university projects or work environments. I am continually trying to focus on improving on my leadership skills, taking the time to learn from and find inspiration in those around me.

I understand that STEM fosters a growth mindset in order to always improve and set higher goals for myself; by completing this application I believe I am taking the first steps to achieving that goal.","I want to learn how to interact with people in the program in a professional manner and extend that beyond the program into my professional career. I also hope to learn the critical interpersonal and soft skills necessary to further develop my personal brand, particularly through learning sound presentation and leadership skills. Above all, and not necessarily a skill, I hope to draw inspiration from my mentors and peers to further develop a growth mindset, something intangible which will stick with me for the rest of my personal and professional life.","As part of an ENGG1000 mechanical stream we were asked to design and create a vehicle which could navigate itself successfully through an obstacle course. I helped facilitate our group meetings by keeping everyone on track through creation of a project plan. My group was well organised in terms of keeping each other updated on our progress, and willing to help each other when a group member fell behind on their work. This translated directly into a successful vehicle design and creation, with a good performance on testing day. 
","I was part of a MMAN2130 group in which we had to create a pneumatic pump for our main project. It was week 4 and we had struggled to find motivation to create a good design for our initial assessment. By initiating a stronger connection within my group through meetings over skype and face-to-face we were able to successfully create a functional engineering design for our pump, which translated into greater success throughout the semester and our final product. I was able to perform successfully as a team leader by coordinating the group and ensuring we made each other accountable for each task as they were due. It was not through my singular actions but encouragement of all members of my group that created a thriving environment for a cohesive team engagement and overall enjoyment throughout our project together.

Being able to work as a team and speak fluently is also a powerful skill to possess which I, myself, have not mastered, hence I would love to develop this into a confident trait at the program as I firmly believe I will walk away with a new mindset on what makes a great leader, as well as sharing my own ideas and skills with other delegates who also attend.","As a future career, I have shown particular interest in finance and security such as banking and accountancy. I am currently studying a degree in commerce and computer science, however an individual is unlikely to be successful with only a degree because a leader must be a team player who can communicate effectively in a way that cannot be misunderstood. My own verbal and body language isn't exactly perfect, hence this is a particular skill that I would treasure most after completing the STEM Leaders Program as it has benefits reaching far beyond the career setting such as in my own social life when meeting new people in various stages in life. Moreover, another skill that is important to any job within STEM, or any office setting, is the efficient use of a computer in maximising its full potential. This includes preparing presentations and visual aids to communicate to an audience, and also a skill as simple as typing speed and accuracy can go a long way in developing my career.","I strongly believe that i work well in a team especially under pressure such as a time constraint where specific goals must be met. This is a perfect representation of the time I worked at Subway a month ago making sandwiches during rush hour at Westfield. Lines of hungry customers stretched metres for every store in the food court; my team and I were busy assembling sandwiches for up to 5 customers at once between the 3 of us. After I place cheese on the customer's sub, I put it into the toasting oven which takes 30 seconds to complete. As it is toasting, I start taking the next customer's order, and when the sub has finished toasting, one of teammates takes it out of the oven and begins salads. this ensures smooth running of the kitchen floor as e minimise our need to move around which risks dropping food and contamination. Whenever I didn't know how to make a certain sandwich, I would ask my coworkers for help as it promotes communication as well as friendship between the team which leads to greater efficiency, hence I work well as part of a team.","Step back a year into 2017 and I was still finishing high school. I've always been inspired by the university presenters who come and give careers advice and support during the lunch breaks, as I saw a lot of my classmates were attentively engaged in their journey through high school and into university. At those moments, I wanted to be like that, a leader, who inspired younger generations to go above and beyond. I remember when I first began volunteering at my school as a tutor for Year 11 students because of all the successful university students who presented, who were not much older than us to be honest, so i wanted to be like them and help others in achieving their desired goals. Now, fast forward a year, I'm at the University of New South Wales which I back then did not think I could get into but I put my mind to it and pulled through. Currently, I invest a lot of my time into contributing to societies at university (such as Business Society ,and Computer Science Engineering Society) and to assisting the people in my degree in their course work in my free time. Why? Because I do believe that teaching others is a perfect example of being a leader as you show them the way to becoming more successful, however it also provides intensely meaningful experiences for myself too since I evaluate what I do and do not know. Hence, demonstrating strong leadership is key to providing both yourself and others positive impacts that go far beyond the present and into the future, which is what I seek to gain from the STEM Leaders Program.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vASVya5AVBweoUUUKTKpXAPNIK0vHDcr/view?usp=sharing

I have been heavily involved in the Indonesian Students' Association as part of their internal committee member. During our biggest event of last semester, the Charity Gala Night, I was the logistics director. The job involved coordinating with our arts team, events team, delegating tasks to the logistics team itself and also making sure the logistics costs are as low as possible. This require a good grasp of knowledge in working as part of a team to succeed. Between the arts team requesting transportation details, storage details and confirming the props' dimensions are suitable for use in the venue, and informing events team of every dimension of the venue, providing them with all the equipments and tools necessary for them to go wild, communicating well and teamwork was crucial in this experience.","I believe the previous section also demonstrated my leadership experience to some degree. Another time would be when I was the project manager for the aforementioned IndoSoc for our mentoring program. The program is designed to guide first year Indonesian students in the start of their uni life by equipping them with the necessary skillset and also introducing them to seniors and the Indonesian community in general. I designed the curriculum for the program, worked in recruiting the mentors and first years and also planned the mini events throughout the period. We manage to have 20 qualified mentors and 60 mentees involved, distributed into 10 mentoring groups according to their majors and personality traits. The biggest satisfaction of this experience has been when the mentees remarked how useful and fun the program has been, and also when I see the mentors and mentees having a lasting connection even after the program is over.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jl9rH-urpzkHGe0r5uK7IYCbvF2xXoxH/view?usp=sharing

Also, I am rather looking forward to working with industry mentors on real-life engineering projects within a team-based setting, just to get a taste of how working as an engineer in real life is like.","I want to be better versed in writing CVs and handling interviews and talking to persons in the industry, particularly in speaking and writing. Also, an improvement in technical skills such as CAM manufacturing (particular in CNC mills and laser cutters), industrial CAD design and mass production techniques would be useful in the workforce. Also, I would want to improve my skills in report writing, especially when it comes to report writing in a team setting.","I perform adequately well in a team. An example would be my team report for a Biomedical Engineering Course, where a group of 5 students would have to work together and create a 2500 report on Neurostimulators, their applications and design. Due to great team members with a good ethic and combined leadership skills, the work was distributed evenly, with a high standard of work done by all team members. I worked well in the team by a mixture of compromising between using other team member's ideas instead of my own. Most (if not all) deadlines set by the team were met on time, with a final report result of 93% (High Distinction).","During this semester, I demonstrated leadership as I volunteered for UNSW in the AHEGS accredited Peer Mentorship Program, where I acted as a peer mentor to a small group of 7 first year Engineering students. As part of the program, I met up weekly with my mentees, helping them to adjust to university life and culture through a mix of bringing them on campus tours, referring them university facilities and introducing them to societies and events. The program also involved an intensive training day, as well as planning routinely for weekly meetings. I led the group along with another mentor, and we planned meetings throughout the week and tried our best to catch up with our mentees and ask them about their experience with uni, and offering help if they needed it. The mentees themselves enjoyed the program, made good friends which other, joined societies (and society projects) and even went to society camps together! Overall, everyone benefited from the program, with the mentees making new friends and adapting to uni life with greater ease, and the mentors learning new leadership skills and being able to help new students by sharing our experience of university. Although the program is now over, the group is still active and I still continue to support them with any queries they have about university and uni life.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1alMRpp-RI1_zBYWOyzKpIxdlGRSjb9EK/view?usp=sharing

I also want to be able to experience teamwork with more refined individuals from professional backgrounds so that I can become one of those refined individuals myself.  
","Although I'm confident in my social skills, I have much to learn. I want to be able to grasp some fundamentals when it comes to networking with higher-up individuals that are involved in big companies and firms. I want to be able to communicate on the same wavelength as professionals so that I can converse about intelligent and relatable topics within industry that may affect my career further in the future. ","I've always been big on team projects and team work. I always prefer teamwork tasks as I like to learn about others and their opinions. I believe I work very well in a team environment because I have always involved myself in team tasks since highschool. The main example I would provide is the opinions that others have placed upon me and how I perform as both a leader and mediator for teams. Often when I play sports or perform group tasks, I am in charge of maintaining direct and effective communication between members of the team. A prime example of this would have to be during my ENGG1000 team task. For this task my teammembers and I were all assigned to review each other and how they performed, for my profile I saw that my teammembers appreciated me for always understanding and taking into account the ideas that everyone had for our project, this was mainly because I tried to incorporate all the ideas that everyone had in our project design. ","I believe that I have always had the qualities of a leader and that I have provided sound examples of this throughout my highschool years. Although this seems repetitive, I believe that sports is a great activity that helps to hone and refine the skills of leadership and teamwork. My experiences as both a team coach and team captain throughout highschool on the basketball team helped me to become a better leader every year. I even took leadership roles as the Arc Delegate of the UNSW Basketball Society during my first and second year of Uni. I believe that I have the ability to be kind but also stern when I communicate with fellow team members. I think that the accumulated experiences I've had as a leader prove my ability, however, I think my strongest quality is my act of sacrifice. I am always willing to do the task that noone wants to do but has to be done, I believe that taking a task head on and not avoiding the challenge is the downfall of a team.

Other than the typical working as team, I feel communication with others to develop other people potential and motivate them is an important factor for my career development but also people around me. Other specific skills include a mind to be innovative and able to drive for results. This skill can relate to problem solving and face challenges by analysing what needs to be done. ","I perform exceptionally well as a team, and to give a recent example will be volunteering for ASPIRE and with a team we managed to overcome a lot of high school students and ensure they are having fun and safe time. Communicating and helping another ASPIRE member achieved a successful event and this was due to a strong team working together.

We were a team of 6 and the trip was 500 km across the frozen sea ice of north Canada. On this trip I saw how vital teamwork is. Alone neither one of us could have made the trip. I learned to motivate others, communicate effectively under stress and share workload; taking on a greater share when others needed help, and allowing others to help me when I needed it. Spotting when others struggled and giving the proper amount of motivation, leads them to exceed what they think to be possible.

This was seen when i was doing Photovoltaic Project 2. We had to build a compost brewer and also put in monitoring measures for it. I did some research on different monitoring measures and since we were given a budget and time period I had to cater it to that. Many groups ended up picking many monitoring measures but I decided that will stick to one and do it more effectively and that since we would only have one monitoring measure if something were to go wrong we could detect it straight away and fix it. I also allocated different tasks to different team members based off their strengths and created a group chat and asked for all their phone numbers. This let us know the progress of each team member and that we could support each other when needed.,"A time when I demonstrated leadership was during my Photovoltaics Project 2 course.

After having a talk with all of them, I found out what there strengths were and allocated tasks to different members. Thus we came tied 1st with another group even though our system was much simpler.

I am eager to learn about the qualities I need to be a good leader in the field of engineering. ,"The last three years I have had to tackle many team projects at university that target the many technical aspects of biomedical, electrical and chemical engineering. My ability to work efficiently in a group has stemmed from the many hours I’ve spent working with my peers solving difficult engineering problems. I have been involved with a biomedical design project using virtual and augmented reality and its applications as intra-operative surgical tool in direct consultation with Westmead Hospital surgeon Dr Vincent Lam. My role in the group was to research and keep track of all the group interactions to ensure the project was headed in the right direction. Throughout the semester there was good communication among team members and project supervisors which helped in us completing the project and achieving a good result. I am also currently working on an interdisciplinary project at Westmead with a diverse group of students. ","In my opinion, the key to leadership is taking on difficult responsibilities and creating a positive environment for the people around you. Through my years in university I have been able to improve my leadership skills through growth and development as an individual. I now find myself paying close attention to what others have to say and finding new ways to contribute to the different group tasks I’ve been involved in. 
In the biomedical design project mentioned above I took the initiative to change the direction of the project even when most of the team members felt unmotivated. There was one aspect of the project that I felt was incorrect (chemical technique using florescence that was not working) so I proposed to the team a way of dealing with the issue with the little time we had left. At the end it paid off and our final product was much more impressive without the component that was causing issues.

I've experienced a range of engineering, innovation and entrepreneurship mentoring programs and I'm more inspired than ever to start creating and innovating. I strongly believe that these years at University are precious and filled with opportunity at your finger tips. I'm very grateful to be a part of such a supportive community like UNSW and I refuse to let these years be sold short of their full potential.","I remember the Dean of Engineering Mark Hoffman distinctly saying ""What's of greater importance is everything you achieve outside the classroom"" during a talk he was giving last year. I may not always get impressive marks in uni, however, I am confident in my ability to learn and I'm determined to become as USEFUL as possible in my uni years and that to me means developing REAL SKILLS. Real skills to me at this point personally means: Soft skills, communicating clearly and confidently, leadership skills, confident public speaking.","Last year I participated in the Maker Games. It was an eye opening experience for me regarding both STEM technical skills, the business world and leadership. I was leading a team of 4 (2 of which I had never met before the competition). I believe I did well in this team seeing as I organised our meetings, delegated tasks according to skill set and completed a large amount of the design myself. We actually functioned outstandingly well and complemented each others skills amazingly. We ended up making it to the final showcase.

Due to my prior experience with leading a team in the Maker Games 2017 and in UNSWOT 2017/2018 I found myself naturally taking on the team leader role in the Heroes Program. On day 1 I instinctively formed goals/milestones and a vision for our team then proposed the vision to the team and got us discussing step 1 to reaching our goals. Throughout the program my team really appreciated my organisational efforts as well as my technical contribution and I thoroughly appreciated each of my fellow team members and loved every second working with them. We connected so extremely well as a team because we were very open and upfront with our thoughts and super supportive in our agreements and respectful in our disagreements. Near the end of the program when nerves were increasing and stress was high, some of my team members were considering giving up, however, I successfully motivated them to give it everything for this last stretch.

Interpersonal skills such as presentation and communication will be extremely useful in case competitions as well as the consulting industry, things that I hope to be involved in. Furthermore, the team project will allow me to collaborate with various students to simultaneously gain practical experience and increase my network.","I perform well in teams by continually improving my teamwork and communication skills. This is done through constant participation in various projects and jobs. A project that I’m currently involved in is the Sumobots competition. As the team leader I understand that my team members are very busy with university, work and other commitments. I motivated them to do work as this is not too high on their priorities list. We all proposed different ideas for our initial design which was then discussed in detail. We offered constructive criticism about each one in a considerate manner to prevent tension between members. I also arranged meetings for us to meet up and work on the project. However, there have been times where there have been sudden changes of plans and they can’t attend anymore, I am understanding and patient so another time is scheduled without any arguments.","After I graduated school, I took a gap year and worked for the Australian Army. I witnessed the positive impact of great leaders as well as how my leadership skills boosted the morale of my fellow soldiers. During basic training we were forced to transition from civilians to soldiers and completed many training exercises designed to simulate real combat situations. I was tasked to take control of my squad and protect an area for 2 days. There was always a possible threat meaning the area had to be covered at all hours, even during the night. A night shift roster was required to ensure the area was protected. Many people pitched the standard idea of getting up at your rostered time, completing a shift then going back to sleep. However, I noticed the many flaws of this plan such as how the guard may fall asleep or be incapable of protecting the area and alerting the others due to other circumstances. This resulted in me creating a new type of roster that removed all of the risks mentioned above while maximising everyone’s rest time. It consisted of a two-hour shift with two guards, their shifts were staggered meaning the guard that started earlier leaves halfway through the second guards shift to fetch the new one. This removed the need for long shifts, the risk of a guard falling asleep and reduced the pressure on the guards. After testing this strategy on the first night, everyone was well rested with high morale which was extremely important in those situations. The same strategy was used the following night and successfully stopped an attempted attack. My strategy and motivational skills were so effective that it boosted our performance and at the end of the training exercise, we were titled the highest performing squad.

Recently with my startup company we have hit many design conflicts between me and my other founder although a lot are miss communications, I have been trying a strategy more recently where we decide on common goals and whichever design or idea fits those common goals that we have both agreed to is the best idea. which has saved a lot of conflict as  we would be working on the same promotion poster before but with different ideas of what its communicating and so that will just lead to conflict. So I have started taking time to see their opinions of what its supposed to do and discuss the best way to do it and then we can reach an obvious and simple solution together. because a good part of leadership is constructive building of ideas with your team and helping to facilitate progress.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m4kM1ypF2sHLo7yPhA7ApfahW-sttMvu/view?usp=sharing

As such, I see much potential in this program, where I hope to gain key insight into those professional development skills that I believe I so lack. Moreover, the “chance to collaborate alongside industry leading firms” (as proclaimed in the event description!) is something that really appeals to me as I’d love to get more of this type of exposure, hoping to learn more about what industry is about and overall just use this knowledge to motivate me in making those future endeavours.","The main overarching skill I hope to gain from this program is communication—which, to me, encompasses both those written and verbal skills that are so key in career development. In improving my written communication skills, I hope to be able to successfully write more applications like these, as well as create a much better resume than what I have now...as seen in my attached CV, there’s LOTS of room for improvement there! For gaining verbal skills, I hope to practice good dialogue in both interviews and oral presentations; as someone who has had very little experience (I’ve only done one interview in my whole life!) and is quite clueless about what employers search for during interviews, I’d love to learn more about self-presentation in these contexts. Moreover, this program appears to involve a lot of team/group-based activities, where I hope to better my teamwork/effective communication skills with my peers.","As a MATSOC exec and EngSoc Subcom member, it is crucial that I am always exercising good teamwork skills. Both my roles in these two societies are largely focused on organising events, which requires me to work collaboratively with a group of people. This means that I have to be a good communicator, being able to share and convey my ideas in a way that others can clearly understand, as well as being open to the ideas of others. Due to the diverse range of personalities I am often surrounded by, I do my best to conduct myself in a way that minimises the chance of conflict, as well as being able to encourage the team to work effectively towards our goals. My ability to work in a team is always reflected by the success of the events we run and the close relationships I have built within these societies!","In 2017, I became the first-year representative for MATSOC (the constituent society for Materials Science & Eng students). This role meant that I was the main point of contact between the students in my cohort and the MATSOC team; students could communicate to me both their questions and expectations of both the school and the society, where I would be the one to bring their concerns to the fore. As I mentioned in the previous question, I was also required to engage in the organisation and planning of various events—all of which aimed to create opportunities for students to interact and bond with one another. As such, learned to appreciate the value of being able to network and get involved with the community, feeling humbled by the way I was able to contribute to the relationships and sense of community built within the materials cohort. In this way, I felt I was able to positively impact and enrichen the uni experience of others. Carrying out this role also had positive repercussions on myself as a person as I felt I was really able to develop and demonstrate a comprehensive set of leadership skills, whether it be those interpersonal skills (such as being approachable, confident and understanding, whilst also being able to display effective teamwork and communication skills) or my organisational skills in event planning and careful time management. At the end of last year, MATSOC conducted a debrief session, where we each anonymously filled out forms to review the other members in terms of their value to the society and how well they carried out their role. Here, I received lots of praise for those aforementioned skills and the overall value the rest of the exec team felt for me as an increasingly active member.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UjAU3acoj3Y50DCdvzxDNRrhbbqFM9db-eQaI-V-XAU/edit?usp=sharing

On the field it is important that each individual player contributes to their role and doesn't get lost performing another players duty because then not all the areas are covered. More importantly, each player has to be able to integrate with the teammates around them and keep control of the ball. As a team we also have to be able to cover for each and communicate effectively as possible. The player with the ball cannot see whats behind them easily so communication is critical. ","It was my first year engineering group project and we had a member who wasn't quite contributing or attending meetings as much as the other members. I spoke to him addressing the issue and proposed what could be done to help with it as well as talking to the rest of the team about it. He then started working a lot better with the team and engaging in meetings. We were a much stronger team afterwards and ended up coming first in the project.

I'm often chosen to be the leader in group projects and have been captain in my soccer team for many years.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WXAUfj4MamWzWPWtJ9HNc5uz0jcHppt8

Currently, I am participating in ENGSOC's Engineering Industries Program and I am enjoying learning about the foundations for presenting. However, rather than working on a range of engineering cases in EIP, I would prefer to work on civil engineering cases to get a better understanding of the civil industry, which I believe the STEM leaders program offers. On top of this, the resume writing and presentation skills workshops by RSE during the EIP program makes me more passionate about applying for the program because it proved that not only does RSE have a structured and effective routine but they also have the connections into the STEM industry that I could experience.","I would like to improve my confidence and communication especially when networking and presentations. I believe that through the STEM workshops and overall five day program, I can improve on my confidence and communication by being put into new environments and situations. The opportunity for connecting with people already in the industry when networking and presenting allows for a deeper development of my professional communication, which I have little experience with. 

Another skill I would like to enhance is my teamwork ability, in regards to efficiently working with different types of team personalities. Until now, I have worked with groups on assignments and other projects. However, I will need to work with more groups to experience a wider range of personalities and to better adapt to new work routines and understand different perspectives. This skill will be beneficial as an intern fitting in with the overall team dynamic. ","Usually, my role in teams is as the completer who is task-orientated and organises a structure for completion of the overall project to complete the task by the deadline. From my personality, I try my best to get along with everyone in my team and make sure they understand the work they need to complete. 
 
Last semester I had a group assignment where one member did not understand his allocated task and did not mention this to the team. I noticed this and talked to him after the group meeting to ask if he was confused either about anything project related. From this discussion, I helped him clarify his task and how that related to the overall project. I believe this interaction was helpful in making sure the overall team dynamic went more smoothly, since it prevented further conflicts about incomplete work and gave him someone to rely on. ","Currently, I am a UNSW demonstrator for two civil engineering courses leading classes of up to 30 students. From this experience the most important lesson I have learnt related to leadership is that everyone has their own way of doing things. 

At the start of the semester for the first year ENGG1000 classes that I am teaching, one of my students asked me what year I was in as they thought I looked too young to be a teacher from their standards of just entering university. 

At this moment, I realised that it would be beneficial for their learning to have a mentor-mentee relationship with my students rather than a teacher-student relationship, which I had little experience with. I applied this by continually going around to the groups having a quick chat about university life, making sure they were on the right track and checking if they understood what they needed to do.  

This helped me connect with my students as I seem more approachable as a source of support and the overall environment of the class has become more friendly and less demanding. Through having my students ask questions more often and participate in group discussions, I have been improving my communication and leadership ability, which would have been difficult if my class had remained shy and felt uncomfortable. Talking to my students has also helped me understand what content I do know and what I don't know, and I have been reflecting on other aspects of my life such as my career goal and abilities.

This program will aid me in the improvement of my soft skills set, professional development and the abilities to perform as a brilliant leader. The Soft Skills workshops provided will not only challenge me in my communication and problem-solving skills but also greatly benefit my technical capabilities in the engineering industry. The professional development workshops will improve my presentation skills and ability to showcase my skills sets to company employers. Work based projects will provide exposure to working collaboratively with other engineers as well as giving a glimpse of the inner workings of real-life engineering companies. Meeting industry experts, mentor and other STEM students will allow me to expand my network in preparation for the industry. All of this greatly contributes to the development of my potential as a mechanical engineer.","Throughout this program I aim to acquire the skills to be able to obtain my desired job in the industry, I will build the confidence and experience to be eloquent in interviews and gain the ability to display my capabilities to potential employers. Additionally, I seek to enhance and fortify my currently soft skills set to further degrees as well as advancing my project and time management skills to be able to establish thoughtful schedules preventing falling behind in projects and goals. Developing my teamwork and leadership qualities will also allow me to connect positively with others in a professional environment.","Teamwork is a crucial factor to any engineer’s successful career, engineering is all about working cohesively and utilising different individual’s strengths to achieve innovation. During one of my courses last semester my team of 8 individuals had to perform a presentation on ‘Project Management – Monitoring and Closure’ as well as providing relevant activities to the audience. After putting together our presentation we find that although we were satisfied with our activities, they do not work well with a large audience, so we took an innovative approach and became the only team to split the presentation into 4 simultaneous sessions and rotated the audience so that everyone’s group was more focused and manageable. The presentation ended in a success because the team was able to work together on this new approach.","Leadership is the management of a collection of individuals, a leader is someone who will turn a group into a team. Successful leaders will display their diligence, vision and goal for the team to follow as well as providing motivation and cohesion without excluding any individual. During my part time job at Coles I was placed in charge of the dairy department whilst still having the position of team member for the duration of my manager’s 1 month leave. The department consisted of 8 team members working accordingly to the roster I make every week. After the absence of the manager it could be seen that some of the team member’s morale and the quality of work was decreasing so I had to take the initiative and approach those fellow team members in a way that would not offend them as I was not in a higher position but exacting enough that they understood the problem and are willing to fix their actions. Though it was exhausting I had managed to maintain the condition of the department, performing all the manager’s weekly duties and ensuring all the team members were on good terms and did equal amounts of work during their shifts.",https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s8ud37d863ckft9/AAAemxI_04Vwc99vSkn_20wha?dl=0

In the NSW Government Global Scope Program last November, the task of my team is to help Mission Australia build from our analysis and insights to improve their understanding and service delivery to people who are experiencing disadvantage. Unfortunately, we ran into communication problems at the beginning because one of us was often absent from team meeting and didn't feel like to contribute to our whole team. It was my job to manage the team meeting, got everyone’s idea and made sure that we were on the right track. After several times of personal communication with the teammate, I convinced him that being a collaborative team worker is better. Finally, our client Mission Australia was satisfied with our data analysis report as a group, and we got the certificate successfully.","During the third year of my bachelor degree, I was selected as one of the instructors for freshmen at the beginning of the first semester. There were around 30 students under my guidance. As the instructor it was my job to help them adapt to the college life and provide some reasonable suggestions. At first, I scheduled a meeting of the full class, and gave them a whole picture of college life, then I made it clear that this was a brainstorming meeting to come up with options, no idea was stupid and that it was a safe environment for making suggestions. We spent an hour to exchange ideas and I guided them to understand what and how they may want to do in the next four years. Also the class committee is selected themselves during the meeting which is good for the class development as a united group. After the meeting, I assigned each of the class committee to do more research on how to implement their current ideas. Besides, I patiently communicate with all the 30 students to know them better and try to help them find the proper direction for their future development. Although I only helped them for only several months, compared with other classes, my class performed better not only on academic grades but also in other fields, such as arts, sports, etc. Even the teacher asked me to help roll this process out to the freshmen next year.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NOy1qRws8HMyvp9zOE6KYlY5CJ5vJKJY/view?usp=sharing

I also want to join so that I can meet and bond with new people who share common interests with me and form lasting friendships. Ultimately, I want to join STEM due to its various opportunities to increase my professional development, education and believe that it is a platform where I can bond with people and create friendships of a lifetime.","One of my greatest fears is public speaking, thus in completing the program, I would like to gain confidence during interviews and presentations. In my course, I am not majoring in anything STEM-related, but I have a passion for technology and I would love to learn more about information technology, coding, computer science and possible career opportunities that allow me to enter the industry. Thus, in completing this program I would like to develop my soft skills of public speaking and hard skills of STEM industry knowledge in order to develop myself personally and professionally for my future career. ","I perform well in a team as I have interpersonal skills and an open mindset which allows me to bond with new people quickly and set a comfortable and fun team environment. During high school I worked in a team of four acquaintances to organise a fashion show. We were asked to create the program e.g themes, write criteria, budget and find sponsorships etc. Therefore, we decided to gather together in a room everyday for three months and spend time with each other socially in order to understand each other's personalities. This allowed us to brainstorm ideas by bouncing ideas off each other comfortably and as a result were able to raise $4000 for the school. This, I believe that my interpersonal skills and open mindset is what allowed me to create friendships and a fun team environment which ultimately allowed me to work well in this team. ","I participated in a Leadership Program where I was placed in a team of six strangers. In one challenge, our team had to strategise how to migrate all members between two platforms with limited equipment. Our team struggled to come up with a strategy as four of the members were frantically executing their individual plans within the time limit. When one of my team members, Olivia came up with a viable plan and tried to voice out her strategy, the other four team members were too busy frantically executing their own strategies and would not listen. Therefore, I calmed down the chaos, got everyone’s attention and explained Olivia’s strategy to them. As a result, our team was able to win win the challenge, which ultimately helped us win the program.

My experiences with engineering have mostly been on the academic side throughout university but I have yet to apply for any programs that are related to the industry. Since I lack both knowledge and experience, this leadership program will give me a wide scope of the roles and skills required to be successful as an engineer. I would also like to have a mentor that has more experience and knowledge because their advice and support would help build both my knowledge about the industry and practice communication at a professional level. The team projects presents an opportunity to interact and work with other students aspiring to become engineers and leaders in the future, which additionally will help build my teamwork, communication and organisation skills. ","A skill that I require honing is management and strategic thinking. My current skill level are average as I have had some management tasks required for academic projects and group assignments. I am good at thinking strategically but I cannot manage which ideas are the most ideal and functional as past experiences have indicated that the ideas that I had chosen to implement was not utilised to the fullest extent. If I am accepted to the program, I will use the workshops to improve the quality of ideas rather than producing a large quantity of ideas. Another skill that I would like to build is my leadership skills. I have never partaken in any leadership role that did not involve academic work so I have little experience with leadership that would be applicable for industrial work. I hope that the program would give me an opportunity to practice and apply the lessons that they teach so that I can be a capable leader in the industry.","In a team, I am always actively participating in any aspect of the task. I will have a serious manner when working as a team to ensure the tasks are done on time and with high quality. Most of the time, I track the progression of the group to make sure tasks are done successfully before planning the next steps. I had been accepted to a volunteering program called Yellow Shirts which requires us to undertake several jobs throughout O-week in our teams. One of the jobs that we successfully ran was the fairy floss shift. This shift occurred during the middle of the day, making it a busy shift for us. Some members of the team still did not have lunch yet. To uphold the efficiency of producing fairy floss from the machine, three people were making and preparing the fairy floss while the rest were taking their break. Each time when we had to reset the machine, we rotated around with other members, making our production the same amount while giving everyone enough time to rest.","A time when I displayed leadership was at a previous workplace in a pharmacy as a cashier. In the situation, a customer brought one of the electric products bought from our store. They claimed the device to be faulty because whenever they used the product at home, their electricity shut down. One of the pharmacists decided to test the device in the store to check if their claim was true. When they plugged it into the store, part of the store’s electricity had shut off. This was an extremely undesirable situation because the computers in the store are used to prescribe medication and it happened during the busiest time of work. As there were customers waiting, we needed power to return fast to minimise the loss of customers and maintain our services. While my colleagues, who are in a higher position, were panicking, I stayed calm to think about how I could resolve the issue. I took over the problem while I got my colleagues to attend to the customers while they waited. Using my high school knowledge, I figured out that the device caused the circuit to break so I went to find the circuit panel. I was able to turn the electricity back on and we were able to resume customer service with the computers back on. In the situation, I demonstrated that I can take initiative as a leader to act and think clearly as I was able to resolve a problem under an urgent situation.

My openness and respect for my team members ideas, opinions and values allowed me to have a positive team experience and avoid conflict. 
My determination to ensure our team was meeting our weekly checkpoints, led me to continually set goals for not only myself, but for the team and the project development. I ensured that the weekly log reports were completed and encouraged my team members to contribute to them.

In order to prevent our team falling behind and leaving the case till the last minute, I regularly encouraged the team to meet deadlines and complete tasks, to keep them organised. 
I took initiative and created a timetable for my team to input their availabilities to make it easier for our team to collaborate and work together. This enabled us to meet regularly and discuss our progress and research in the case, so we could all be up to date with our team’s progress. 
By setting weekly goals and helping everyone stay organised, we were able to manage our time effectively in preparing for our presentation. Because I was highly organised, I was available to readily assist my team members in the final research and preparing of speeches.
Furthermore, I was also responsible for designing and creating the slides for our presentation. By developing engaging colourful slides and completing them early on in our case, I was able to inspire the team to complete their work and be more engaged in the case.

Volunteers go to schools to help students create and program lego robots and let them realise how amazing STEM can be. Now I am a part of the subcommittee, as the Training Lead. The role involves helping to creating, writing, reviewing scripts and workshop content, presenting and overseeing the other general volunteers. I also help to train our volunteers to build the robots themselves first, so that they can teach it to students at the school outreach workshops. On some workshops I help ensure that all team members have all the workshop equipment needed before heading as well. 
The team president, Maria, has been a big source of inspiration to me. She is always willing to go the extra mile to ensure everyone has benefitted from any society activity. This includes the students at workshops being exposed to the world of STEM. It also includes us subcommittee, committee and other members realising what we do as a society is fulfilling indeed, and that we learn and gain as much as possible from our volunteer hours. I have learnt a lot from the way she handles flow of events. When something unexpected happens, she remains calm enough to make improvisations. It has helped me reflect on my tendencies to be rigid with plans, and I have since adapted to become more flexible just by thinking, ""What would our president have done in this situation?"".

The program would allow me to stand out professionally, an especially important factor in an increasingly thriving and competitive industry. Furthermore, I want more than to be able to simply produce something that may be practical and useful, but to also make a real impact through the technical skills I will be able to learn and hone. The importance of leaders in any industry cannot be emphasised enough, and through this program, I hope to develop myself as one with the potential to be a true leader for others from all that I aim to learn.","As with many applicants, I wish to gain and develop as many professional skills as I can throughout the duration of the program. However, specific skills that I will be targeting for development and improvement include my oral communication ability, interpersonal skills, and leadership. In particular, I look to be a better communicator of concepts and ideas and to be able to convey information in an engaging manner. Honing myself as a better communicator will also contribute to building upon my interpersonal skills, mainly the ability to present myself professionally and how to develop the professional relationships that I hope to build. I also aim to become a better leader to most effectively unite a team towards an ultimate goal, being able to take responsibility for task delegation, maintaining professional communication, all whilst keeping people motivated.","Through my experiences as a student, there have been many opportunities to work within a team that have been reflective of the nature of a professional environment through the skills to be learned and challenges to be overcome, pointing to the importance of teamwork and cooperation. On one of my Duke of Edinburgh adventurous journeys, it was nearing sunset and our team was lost, just as one of our team members fell and injured themselves. Together, we consulted the map wherein it was decided that we should split into teams, one which would backtrack our previous paths, whilst the remaining team would redistribute the rucksack contents of the injured team. Through this strong display of teamwork, the entire team reached the campsite in time for dinner (despite being the last team to arrive). My ability to stay mentally focussed and perform well throughout the dire situation further reflect upon my resilience and strong performance when working in a team.","My high school has an annual tradition for the graduating cohort, wherein each year we would be allowed to make a ‘Year 12 Video’ to look back over their journey through high school, whilst also making fun of pop culture and other notable events that took place during our final year. Due to various deadlines and commitments that had been made by the students that volunteered to make the video, we realistically had less than a month to produce the video before we would graduate. Although the team had vague ideas on what to feature in our video, no real progress had been made in its actual production. Our head director who was very passionate towards film, called us to have a meeting and ensure we would have a final product that everyone would be proud of in time for our graduation ceremony. Despite the pressure of his own major work deadlines, he was able to allocate roles, oversee the majority of filming (and post-production) and keep the team well-informed. He was open to and facilitated new ideas to add to the video, promoted team effort for further motivation and was able to clearly identify goals for us to achieve from the tasks we were delegated. The foundations for the team were built upon his initiative to take a leadership role and ultimately build strong relationships that would further reinforce a ‘team spirit’ in arguably the most stressful year of many students lives. The final product was extremely well received by the entire school (especially our cohort), provoking much laughter and joy yet also tugging at emotions through the many memories that would be shared.",
4/26/2018 17:07:46,Robert Agaba,nera2499@gmail.com,425125633,2,UNSW,Civil Engineering (Honours),Civil Engineering,Facebook,"The reason I'm applying for the STEM Leaders Program is because I am excited to create a brand for myself that I can foster and develop to support my transition into the industry. Being only second year, I have yet to experience any industrial or professional environments and thus understandably lacking in communication and networking skills needed as a foundation for my industrial career. After reading about Real Skills Education, I'm confident in this program's professional development workshops, industry projects and networking opportunities provided through the support of their many partners such as the world-class, global consulting agency, Accenture.
Furthermore, what made the decision to apply for the SLP so easy was the fact that Nikolay Kumsiashvili, my former ENGG1400 tutor, is an alumni of the program. Being taught by him, I witnessed first hand the impressive results of the SLP and realised I would be passing up a valuable opportunity to guarantee my success in the industry and also network with passionate and like-minded peers and mentors.","Some of these skills I already possess but I wish to improve my capabilities:
- interpersonal skills: this will be essential, being able to confidently communicate with all types of people from businessmen to graduate colleagues and will help with networking
- teamwork skills: to be able to work successfully in a team environment, conveying your ideas while listening to the opinions of others and making the best decision as collaborating with others is a major part of what an engineer does
- leadership skills: being able to conduct a group brainstorm session or delegate responsibilities is important if willing to become a senior engineer or even lead my own projects
- positive mindset: being able to embrace failures and successes alike opens the doors to be able to continuously improve myself as I become more resilient and am faced with more challenging experiences later in my career","Recently, after joining EngSoc this year, I was placed in the marketing portfolio and we were placed in a group of three consisting of two subcom members (Tim and I), and a director to help/oversee our progress. Our task was to create a cover photo for the Volunteer Development Program charity event using photoshop within a week. Between Tim and I, Tim was experienced in using photoshop while I wasn't, however I had previous experience brainstorming with a team to create posters for my high school environment group. As a result we decided to divide the workload into parts that would complement our skills. So I ended up finding inspiration and direction for our cover photo, then drawing up a draft cover photo and presenting it to the director for confirmation before passing it over to Tim to actually procure it in photoshop. This strategy streamlined our process significantly allowing us to complete it in 2 days over a total of 3 hours when the expected duration was 6 hours, quantitatively halving the time spent. ","An example of a time I showed initiative as a leader was at work at the tutoring company Intuition Education. We were only 3 markers as staff was undermanned that day however we needed to mark 24 HSC papers in 4 hours. This was a tall task as it would usually take 3 markers up to 6 hours. The standard marking process would just be us each marking 8 papers each however I came up with an idea to speed up the marking process. As HSC papers are divided into sections, I delegated sections to each of us 3. One person was assigned multiple choice, one short answers, and one long responses. This allowed us to familiarise ourselves with the questions and answers faster resulting in a quicker marking pace since we only had a third of a paper to remember. As one person finished one section they passed it to the next person to do the next section who then passed it on to the third person to do the last section. We ended up finishing the 24 papers in just under 4 hours. This was extraordinary accomplishment as we shaved off 33% off our marking speed.

This proved to leave a positive impact at the centre as it's still used now, a few months later. Due to wanting to minimise risk of losing papers, this process isn't used everyday, however whenever there are few markers, seniors encourage the use of this strategy to maximise productivity.","LinkedIn:

I have ambitions to become a software developer in the future, currently undertaking Commerce and Computer Science, which both complement each other in the corporate tech industries. I believe this opportunity will provide me the ability to build new connections and relations with other people in the tech industry and alumni. Furthermore, this will allow me to apply my skills and learn new skills in an active workplace.","I want to be able to learn the skills necessary to be successful in internships and applying for jobs in the future. As a first year, I want to participate and indulge in the different opportunities available for me to be prepared for the workforce for when I graduate. Communication, networking, interview tips are among some of the skills I am hoping to gain out of this program, as well as the chance to just take part in it.","I am beginning to volunteer for UNSW CSE Society events, and the main part of helping out is working as a team to deliver quality events to the student body. I assisted in the weekly BBQs through setting up and cooking, which involved hours of commitment and needed me to be quick with what I did. Our team would ensure we all were hydrated and could take regular breaks, substituting among each other whenever one of us felt fatigued. I maintain consistent communication between team members, not only in specific events, but also through planning and preparation to ensure the events we run are full of quality and enriching for the student body. The success of our communal events is usually reflected in our efficiency to work and deliver results, which often translate to strong teamwork.","When I was volunteering for the Salvation Army’s Red Cross Shield Appeal last year, I was placed in an unknown team and wanted to try to raise over $500 in 2 hours. My team didn’t try that much and would double up on houses, so I decided to take the planning into my own hands. This involved planning out a clear route and set targets for every 30 minutes. Additionally, we also attempted to split off and handle 5 doors at a time to maximise profits, This greatly improved our efficiency at tackling the fundraiser and overall showed my capabilities to take the initiatives to coordinate my group. My peers was also able to feel a sense of accomplishment, knowing that they have successfully raised over $600 with this method of planning and teamwork.

This program also provides a unique opportunity to work with industry leading firms that provide support whilst undertaking a variety of projects. By participating in the STEM leaders program I will be able to improve on soft skills including communication, leadership, initiative and team work which are instrumental in the workplace. Furthermore, the statistic that over 35% of people who have completed the STEM, have been able to secure internships and professional roles persuaded me to do this program. With the current competitive climate in obtaining internships, I believe that participating in this program will give me the best possible head-start in the engineering field and allow me to work with like-minded and passionate individuals.","By completing this program, I would like to develop my leadership, communication and teamwork skills through exposure to real world applications such as networking and presentations. I believe that leadership constitutes demonstrating confidence and a clear vision to convince colleagues to embrace their own proposals and ideas and this is a skill that I wish to develop through the STEM program. These facets are crucial to a leader inspiring their colleagues to achieve their full potential. Also, I would like to improve my resume writing as the ability to clearly outline your achievements, involvement in extra-curricular activities and interests is crucial in obtaining internships and professional roles. The ability to work with industry leading firms means that I will have the opportunity to learn off experienced individuals and thus improve my skill set. ","I believe that I understand my role in a team and adhere to it. During the Volunteer Development Program at UNSW, I organised a charity event with four other group members to raise awareness for the Fred Hollows Foundation. Our event involved throwing a ping-pong ball into a cup with and without cataract glasses to simulate the visual impairment associated with cataracts. However, due to the bad weather we weren’t attracting as many people to our store as we had hoped for. Instead, I decided that instead of expecting people to come to us, why not go to them. We used our practical skills as we taped the cups to the back of a white board and asked people if they would like to attempt throwing a ball into the cups. Thus, I made a positive contribution to the team as we got more people involved than if we simply stood at our stall expecting people to arrive.","As part of a course to study the progressive collapse of a building, myself and four other group members were given the task of constructing a model building to withstand a 5kg weight and the impact of a small vehicle. The first task involved coming up with a draft design for the structure of the building, however this resulted in heated discussion with differing viewpoints. Whilst some argued that the structure should consist purely of trusses for increased rigidity others argued that this wasn’t sufficient to withstand the force of the vehicle and support the 5kg weight. So to resolve the issue, I proposed that each person come back next week for a meeting with their own design.
The following week we each revealed our own design for the structure of the model building. In order to be diplomatic and I suggested that there be a show of hands for each design and the three most popular designs would be chosen. Having decided on the three most favourable designs, I enquired about which aspects of each design did everyone want to see in the final design. We deduced what the structure of the building would look like and then used AutoCAD to calculate the stresses on each section of the structure. This allowed us to determine the practicality of the design and if it could resist the force of the 5kg weight and the momentum of the small vehicle. 
In this way, I showed leadership and initiative by demonstrating confidence and a clear vision to convince colleagues to embrace my proposal. Also, I was able to inspire my group members to achieve their full potential by resolving a heated discussion and converting it into a constructive situation.

One of many reasons why I chose to apply for this program is due to the exposure we get with industry experts and mentors outside of uni. The aspect of being able to apply my critical thinking and technical skills in work-based learning projects in collaboration with industry partners really appealed to me. This program also provides me with the platform to improve my confidence and soft skills through its multiple workshops. I also applied as this program will give me great insight about the current trend in the STEM industry. Using the skills and experiences I attain from this program, I hope to stand out above other STEM students when it comes to networking events, presentations and make myself a more experienced and appealing candidate at job interviews. ","Through the completion of the program, the specific skills I would like to gain include collaboration, leadership and networking skills. I believe these skills are crucial for STEM students in the workforce and would aid me significantly in my career development. Participating in workshops and team projects allows me to strengthen my leadership skills by assisting to lead my team mates to solve industry problems. I will learn how to effectively collaborate in a team environment with other members and mentors to achieve certain goals. Through this program I also wish to improve my networking skills and increase my confidence in talking to industry experts, mentors and other STEM students. These specific skills will aid in my career as potential employers often look for STEM students who are able to use their leadership skills to smoothly manage a team and effectively collaborate with other members to successfully complete projects. ","I believe I perform well as part of a team and excel within a team environment. I have a positive attitude towards tasks and be can relied on by other members to complete all responsibilities within deadlines. An example of when I excelled as part of a team can be seen from my experience working as an office assistant. This role required me to work cohesively with three other members of the admin team to accurately and efficiently complete general admin documents and duties. I think I worked well as part of this team since I was able to confidently communicate and express my ideas about how to approach tasks with other members. I felt I was a very respectful and honest, respecting the values and opinions of others. I believe I was a very helpful member, sacrificing my time to help others to ensure the office ran smoothly. ","Whilst I was participating in the 2018 Career Leaders Program at UNSW, I was able to observe effectively leadership by the career mentors which positively impacted both myself and others. After learning from these mentors, I was later given the opportunity to demonstrate my own leadership skills to make a positive impact on others. During this program the career mentors would demonstrate effective leadership by giving a general briefing of the required goals and targets for the day. They were super organised and were able to delegate everyone roles and assign duties that were required to be completed by career leaders. The mentors were strongly motivated and were always willing to help, possessing the characteristics of a greater leaders. Their proactive and helpful nature created a calming and stress-free environment for others. This made a huge positive impact on both myself and others as it made everyone feel comforted and secure, allowing people to share their ideas and ask for assistance in a risk-free environment. Their leadership also kept us motivated and focussed on the task at hand. Inspired by the mentors’ leadership qualities and actions, I was then able to demonstrate my own leadership by managing a small group to carry out tasks around the campus. Following in the footsteps of my mentors, I was able to allocate responsibilities to each member of the group and brief them of what was required to be done. I was also able to guide my group through any hurdles and attend to any queries they had.  This made a positive impact on others as it prevented any confusion and allowed tasks to be quickly and efficiently completed. This also positively impacted on myself, improving confidence knowing that my leadership was achieving results. ",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gToRoFcXwG403foBRsALHHqz5SjCn29u/view?usp=sharing

It would be great for me to have a similar experience in Australia. 
Building practical abilities is a key factor as well. It is a chance for me to integrate theory with practice. With the STEM Leaders Program, I can have a better understanding of the industry, every step and every process.
What is more, I can improve my communication ability through this unique event. Leaders are required to be able to work within a team, communication, therefore, makes a significant influence on the project.
I think the STEM Leaders Program will be inspiring and professional, everyone who attends this program will find it useful and entertaining. Being an engineering student, it is a perfect chance for my personal growth.
Joining a development program is not just a way to get some decoration on my resume but also exciting. I can have access to an amazing event which would be an unforgettable experience.","1. Gain a similar experience in Australia. I worked as a student engineer in a Chinese company for several days, this specific experience, which was inspiring. I have always been curious about civil engineering in Australia.
2. Put theory into practice. Engineering does not always follow the textbook in reality. So, it is necessary for me to take part in the STEM Leaders Program.
3. Improve my communication ability. I will learn to work and build working relationships with varieties of people on this project. It would be great if I can get in touch with creative minds of all ages.
4. Adaptability. During the STEM Leaders Program, I will have to collaborate with people from different cultural backgrounds, which requires me a high level of flexibility and adaptability. Besides, I will face new challenges and changes, both inside and outside the workplace. It can be an essential chance to improve myself.","As one of the UNSW Arc volunteers, this April, I designed a trip with my teammates. We planned this event together, and I suggested making the trip to the Government House of NSW and the Royal Botanic Garden. It would be a history trip.
At first, I booked a guided tour which allows everyone to have a better understanding of history. Then I helped teammates choose the date. After several days of planning, all the details were confirmed.
Our end goal was to make this trip funny so that no one will feel dull, which requires every volunteer to communicate with customers. During the trip, I talked to every customer, made the experience great for them. We were like old friends.
A can-do attitude is essential. Before this event, I had no experience of designing trip. However, when I decided to do something, I would do my best by making sure every detail.","This semester I did a group assignment with my classmates. Our main target is to find a better option between building a new airport and a high-speed rail in Sydney by defining their impacts on the environment.
Our group was split into two subgroups. My subgroup's task was to analyse the airport. At first, I suggested that we can take some other airports that have the similar capacity as the new airport as references so that we can estimate the area and the usage of materials. Airports consist of several parts: runways, taxiways, terminal buildings and parking lots. We also need to find the usage of all the raw materials and how many CO2 emissions. I allocated one of my teammates to do the material part and let the other do the emission part, while I was responsible for calculation.
To find the model of the aeroplanes, we read many documents. After a lot of discussion with teammates, I decided to use the yearly aircraft movements to calculate how many aircraft we need and the capacity of each aircraft.
Then we combined the data we gathered to input into the computer. As the one who guided the team, throughout all the task, I kept communicating with my teammates to make sure there would be a strong link between us. This is significant for teamwork. I also valued the importance of learning from others, which would make our group work perfectly.
It took us three weeks to finish the task, though we faced numerous failures and challenges, it was still an unforgettable experience.",www.linkedin.com/in/guo-chen-chenguo

Additionally, this seems like a great opportunity to make some connections with like-minded people, which will hopefully result in more opportunities. Furthermore, as my friends have told me, STEM Leaders Program provides the participants with a chance to work with industry partners to work on a project, and not only does this sound very interesting, but also will serve as a much need break from submitting lab reports and doing calculations.","I am looking to learn all the skills that will make my internship or job applications, and interviews, more pronounced, be it quality leadership characteristics, way of expressing oneself, or the anything else. Specifically, however, I am hoping to learn how to answer interview questions in a way that will reflect positively on my profile and applications. As an extension to this, another skill I would like to develop from this is to be able to understand exactly what is asked of me, such that I can construct an appropriate and proper response (i.e. what are the employees/coordinators looking for in a survey such as this?).","I perform quite well as a part of the team, and I believe this is due to my flexible and relaxed personality. Throughout my degree so far, I have participated in 5 group assignment/projects, and have been all kinds of different team members; a specialist that focuses on their end of the project, an all-rounder that is in charge of many different aspects, and a team leader. In the most recent team project, I was the team leader and was in charge of the time management, and work allocation. Due to effective planning and distribution of work, the project was very productive and successful, resulting in the completion of the project to a very satisfactory standard. Likewise with all the past team projects, only positive feedback was received (generally 5/5), and a cordial relationship is maintained with teammates. ","The most memorable time when I had demonstrated leadership, was strangely when I played the role of vice-leader for a semester long project in second year, as opposed to the time I was the group leader. The semester was nearing its end and all the other assignments and assessments were due at around about the same time, so everything was fairly hectic for all members of the team. The testing of the physical product that the team had produced had unfortunately failed, put received passing grades. The overall team spirit was down and all members were fairly drained, however, the final report was due that night. Due to the workload throughout the past few weeks, not much progress has been made on the final report, and so all members decided to stay back to either start or complete their assigned sections. As I’ve been working on my individual section beforehand, I finished my section quickly and could have left about 2 hours after the testing. However, I, at the time, begrudgingly decided to stay behind to ensure all work has been done and to assist wherever I can. Initially, the stress, panic, and overall low spirit isolated all members such that they were buried in their own work, but as I decided to go around helping them while making jokes and friendly banter the mood eventually got much better. As more members finished, they too decided to stay behind to ensure completion of task, but also for the enjoyable team atmosphere. I strongly believe that it is with this unintentional act of ‘leadership’, a much more positive atmosphere was produced, which almost directly resulted in the completion of the report at 11:45pm (15 minutes before deadline) and a subsequent very satisfactory result and friendly relationship between all team members.

What’s special about RSE is the opportunity to collaborate with firms (including the first partner, Accenture) with a team of like-minded students who undertake real projects while guided by mentors to develop strong teamwork and professional skills.

I’m interested in the the technology field, namely information systems because of how it makes a difference in improving business operations and finding innovative solutions to problems in the community. Being a STEM student, I would like the experience to learn from both experts in industry and fellow peers, as I believe that diverse backgrounds from all degrees and experience work together to create better products and services for society.","One of the most useful skills that are important in whatever career or STEM field you work in is the way we adapt to new environments and change. This is especially crucial for the information technology sector as this fast-paced industry requires a learning a constant flow of knowledge to keep up to date with new ways of approaching problems. This 5 day intensive program will definitely be a learning curve that I look forward to.

Also, having strong judgement and problem solving skills only comes through experience and learning from others, so the STEM Leaders Program will definitely be a environment where I can gain skills in networking, presentation, resume and learning strategies. Throughout the week, learning how I communicate and work with new people is a skill that I can apply in all areas of university and work. ","Performing well as a team encompasses a range of attitudes and behaviours, and that working hard at learning from failure and weakness can change the way you interact with others for the benefit of the others. An example of cross-disciplinary teamwork was working in a project that aimed to enhance the relationship between student  volunteers and charity organisations. By investing time in understanding each others personality, goals and strengths before approaching the tasks, there was a greater level of trust and a shared common vision to work towards. 

As I was able to listen to other’s with more understanding and agreeableness, I was able to encourage and support others. As a result of this exercise in communication and empathy, we were able to collaborate and coordinate a successful volunteering event which was partnered with a knitting club and a micro-volunteering organisation.","A respectable demonstration of leadership, is when the leader is not just there for himself/herself, but for a cause far greater. This has been exhibited by the Compassion UNSW president, who takes the initiative to create feedback surveys to gauge how each individual feels in terms of their contribution, what they enjoyed and what can be improved. I can say that this has definitely had a positive impact on the whole team because we understand each other better, and this has changed our attitudes when working together. For instance, due to unforeseen circumstances we had to postpone an event, however we didn’t have a backup location and time. Consequently, the number of volunteers on the day were low in number and was more disorganised. The president gathered the whole team to discuss what happened, what we learned, and how we can do a better job next time. We all felt heard and could share our opinions openly to the team, which was a testament to the strategy and execution of her leadership capabilities. 

Relating to the above situation, the way the team responded in cooperating with this idea was crucial in effective discussion. I demonstrated leadership by actively listening to what others have to say. Through little prompts like asking how and why, this helped the team go deeper into the reasons behind the issues and for gaining a shared understanding. Leadership is not telling people what the best way to do a certain task is, but it’s being humble in trusting the group to build on each other’s ideas, strengths and methods. This is highly applicable to workplaces and teams by being able to support a positive environments and relationships.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/geraldtsang/

With the degree I’m pursuing in both Business and Technology, I hope to leverage and synthesise professional and technical skills demanded through the STEM Program, to best prepare for a future of social efficiency from both a business and technical perspective.

Being part of this program will specifically give me an insight to the issues and problems currently faced by communities as well as equip me in being aware of how to communicate and interact in a professional setting. I also hope to bring my creative and interpersonal skills into action as I interact, solve and discuss ideas. 
","First and foremost, I wish to gain more confidence in my career direction, and the program will help to familiarise myself with the various situations, opportunities and ways in dealing with real-life problems.

With this program opportunity I also want to learn to “wear different hats” - to think in different viewpoints (management, business and consumer perspectives) and roles due to the increasing fluidity of workplaces, as employees now aren’t limited to only sticking to what is under their job description.

I also believe that relating to people and places is important within a professional culture, and this program serves as a platform to gain a taste of effective networking and communication as well as being able to understand how industries function and establish relations across companies and within employees. 

Overall, this program will significantly help develop my professional, ethical and social conduct both as an employee and as a person.
","I was part of a basketball team that participated in a regional inter-school basketball competition each week. This meant that I had to balance basketball training and competitions on top of my already busy schedule with piano lessons, work and particularly study, since I was in a selective high-school. I had to have full commitment and motivation in attending training sessions, team building socials and being available for competitions. 

Our team developed solid communication skills over training sessions, which was reflected when we won our competition heat. As team players, we all listened and cooperated with our coaches and our captain, and were able to therefore improve our technical abilities in a positive, encouraging environment.

If anything, I learnt that basketball is a mental game that requires utmost cooperation and commitment in order to do well, which I was able to translate in my work and academic environment.
","During a work shift at San Churro, the POS system we were using had broken down and this meant that customers were not able to pay using their cards, but only with cash for the time being. It also meant that none of the other stations (desserts, shakes, coffee, churros, cashiers) were able to receive customers orders to make, since the wait staff weren’t able to input the orders into the POS system.

This disrupted the efficiency and running of our store and made customers impatient and restless, as those without cash had to go and withdraw from an ATM. The wait staff also had the challenge to ensure that customers didn’t leave without paying especially during peak time.

Nonetheless, our shift team that night displayed cooperative leadership in taking this situation into our hands through a manual approach to our services. Our store manager ensured that we were still able to continue our operations - we were instructed to take orders, calculate the prices and send it to the staff who were making the orders. This required a high level of communication, cooperation, as well as individual and team leadership, as we held a higher responsibility to each other and to the customers. 

I was the cashier that night and it was important to cater for customer needs and to politely explain the situation to them. I attempted to satisfy the customers as best as possible by giving them a 10% discount (agreed upon by the store manager) to their meal as compensation for any possible wait, or extra efforts they had to go to, to withdraw cash. 

It was a positive experience for us as we learnt to deal with a sudden situation that challenged our staff team dynamic and our individual leadership capabilities.

My decision to apply for the STEM Leaders Program primarily stems from the internal desire to make a conscious effort as a first year university student to step outside my comfort zone and try new things. However, upon further reading, the program developed a particular appeal, as it posed itself as a useful tool through which I believe I could, not only develop my interpersonal skills, but additionally gain knowledge of the ever-changing STEM industry. I believe participating in this program will be a rewarding opportunity. It will allow me to develop my communication and leadership skills –  vital traits for working in industry that aren’t explicitly taught within a classroom. I am eager to learn more about the STEM workplace and gain practical experience. I believe that the program will help me be a better engineer and provide a unique opportunity to network with like-minded peers as well as industry leaders. Finally, I am interested to learn more about the STEM Industry and what it entails not only as a degree but also as a career path.
","I hope through completion of this program, I will be able to further develop my leadership and communication skills and also put these said skills into practice. Through this program I hope to specifically hone my abilities in presenting myself in a clearer and concise manner to aid me in the application process for future internship and job opportunities. This includes learning about how to write a proper resume and learning how to create a personal brand to present on professional online tools such as LinkedIn. Furthermore, I hope to gain practice in my networking skills and presentation skills, so I can be better prepared when I giving interviews for internships and job opportunities. I hope these skills will provide me with insightful information that will aid me within in my own studies through university. Overall, I hope to gain a better understanding of what it means to be a leader in the STEM industry, meet fellow peers, build networks and develop my communication and presentation skills to aid my further career development.
","I believe I thrive working in a team environment but I also understand that there is always room for improvement. Recently I worked effectively as a team member in the summer holidays. After the completion of the HSC, I was asked to help plan an event within my language school, to provide insights, guidance and tips about how I managed my final year in high school to students who were about to begin their final year of school. There was a group of 10 students and we had to work as a team to develop a 2 hour event at the end of the school semester in December. I worked alongside the team to first set aside a time when everyone was available to meet to discuss how to plan the event. As an organised person who likes to plan events, I helped lead the team in planning the event. I think we worked well as a team as we used good time management and organisational skills. Also within the team we created an environment of honest communication that allowed for the flow of ideas and meaningful collaboration. Each team member had the chance to speak up and share their ideas as well as give constructive criticism and inform others of their progress. We first developed an overarching structure and aim that we hoped to achieve. Then we created a more detailed plan; we broke down the event into sections and outsourced different aspects of discussion to different members of the team. We implemented a timeline to ensure the planning of the event progressed as expected. As the students we were giving the event to were in the grades below us, we engaged with them briefly as well to understand the concerns and topics they wished to be addressed. As such by using effective communication and breaking down the event into several smaller manageable tasks we were able to successfully pull of the event. Ultimately I think the event was a success much in large to our dedication to the event but also due to our honest communication which set out the goals, commitments and expectations required early on.

","For me great leadership encompasses a combination of different traits and qualities. Leaders should have a clarity and focus in achieving bold visions as well as the confidence and courage to teach and inspire their fellow team members to strive for the highest and achieve their potential. A great leader should also allow for a free and transparent democratic collaboration that ensures every individual is heard, but also have an understanding of how to make decisions even when they aren’t easy. They should strive to effectively communicate goals and set deadlines and finally bestow accountability onto fellow team members to create a sense of responsibility but also be willing to take the fall when things don’t go to plan. A time I demonstrated leadership that have positive outcomes was during an assignment for a group project that was to be completed overs a holiday break. As a group we had implemented a good online communication through which we could discuss our problems and progress over the holidays. Additionally, we split up the work load by assigning different members with different responsibilities. However, one member was overseas during the holidays and didn’t update date us regularly on their work.  Upon arriving back to class and three days before the deadline, the person informed us they hadn’t completed any of the work assigned as they was no longer taking the course. This lack of effective communication affected the entire team. We were under a great deal of pressure to meet the deadline. We were required to complete a workload designed to be completed over 2 weeks in less than three days with a smaller team than we had initially planned. Already having invested so much time and effort in the project, I didn’t want to see the whole team suffer due to the actions of one individual. As I had already been co-ordinating and helping the other team members with their research for the project, I decided the best course of action was to step up and complete the task. I felt it was partially my responsibility as the problem could have potentially been avoided with better communication skills. I put myself forward and took on the majority of the workload, giving some of the workload to my fellow team members. We communicated efficiently and made sure everyone was able to complete the tasks before the deadline. Overall the experience produced a positive impact as we achieved high marks for the project and we were able to overcome the unexpected problem that arose. Through this process, I learned the importance of effective communication and to never assume for a perfect plan to be fully executed. Our team learnt more about resilience and persistence.

4/26/2018 21:46:17,Jai Tamta,jaitamta@gmail.com,404010995,4,UNSW,Civil engineering / Commerce (finance),Civil Engineering,Friend,"The idea of working on practical civil engineering projects within a safe environment greatly interests me, as it would allow me to focus on learning and experience building by applying myself in different manners with the support of industry partners, and potentially find specific industries that interest me. This would be helpful as I’m currently seeking industrial training, and these experiences would help me to adjust to various industrial training environments in a smooth manner and focus on specific industries I’m most passionate about. Also, it would be enjoyable to work alongside other engineering students in collaborative projects and learn something from their experiences. The various workshops teach many skills that are vital to successfully finding potential internships. Such skills are developed informally and with little guidance, so it would helpful to learn these in a structured and assessed manner specifically in relation to finding experience in STEM fields.  ","I’m interested in further developing soft skills that I will utilise when I enter the engineering field, by practicing them through the program projects that will have similar environments to the engineering workplace. Presentation, communication and listening skills could always be improved and are important for any collaborative engineering work that I will do in the future. 
I also want to develop the skills that will better prepare me to successfully find industrial training, such as creating an appealing LinkedIn profile to sell myself, learning how to network effectively or learning from recruiters how better tailor your resume. I find it difficult to learn these skills effectively without external support and critique, so I want to develop them significantly by the end of the program. I want to hone some of my technical skills such as with CAD software’s, so I can readily handle the jobs that require them
","In team environments I make sure to provide insightful contributions and suggestions during discussions, while carefully listening to other members to ensures group discussions are productive. I’m acceptive of disagreements or conflicting viewpoints as it means there are issues with my ideas that I haven’t considered and thus the solution can be improved. I spread this open environment of cordial disagreements with productive conflicts to enrich dialogue within the group while ensuring unproductive arguments don’t arise.  I put significant effort into my roles and consider as many details as possible and encourage other team members to execute their tasks at the highest quality so that the final solution is meticulous and well-rounded. An example was a hackathon in early 2018, about improving living conditions in the Korail Slums. I contributed throughout and willingly dropped a plan of small scale hydroelectricity despite committing significant time to it, in response to asking for assessment/critiques. I also spent time coming up with detailed financing and business models to encourage others to put the same depth in their part.","I demonstrated leadership during an engineering design tour in Thailand, where our group had to find a problem and develop a solution in local village. I emerged as a leader by setting an agenda of what need to be accomplished and when, to ensure that group member don’t get confused and the team progresses efficiently. I allocated group tasks to members based on suitable skills they had and what they wanted to do, so that each member had a say in what role they would be most effective in.
Group discussions were chaired in a systematic manner that encouraged input from all team members, which were then carefully deliberated as a group. This ensured that all decisions were made collaboratively which allowed us to develop a wide variety of potential design solutions based on a varied amount of inputs. These solutions were assessed as a group, where I created pugh charts to explicitly define what criteria the solutions were being assessed against. We discussed each solution and I again encouraged everyone to contribute, until we reached a final design solution that would have lacked the nuanced considerations and wholistic scope without a coherent group effort 
I took initiative in various stages of the design process, such as suggesting that we work with the translators and ask as many people around the village what’s the biggest problem they faced. Upon consensus with the group, I split up the group into 2 smaller groups with one translator each and designated which sides of the village we should go too. This resulted in the development of a human-centred design problem statement.
By taking the leadership role of the group, I was able to structure the group and encourage collaborative work which allowed us to come up with the best design solution in an enjoyable manner without conflict.

4/26/2018 22:15:25,Vivian Szeto,z5162196@ad.unsw.edu.au,468525389,2,UNSW,B.Science (Maths/Stats) and B.Economics (Econometrics),Math/Stats/Data Science,Facebook,"I am interested in the real world applications of my majors and I believe this 5-Day workshop can provide me with invaluable insight to any STEM projects I might have the opportunity to work on in the future. I want to develop myself professionally and I am convinced this program will equip me with better teamwork and communication skills, as well as professional development skills which are all significantly relevant to internship and graduate job positions. ","I am extremely interested in enhancing my professional development skills, as I find that we do not often get the opportunity to learn these essential skills at high school or university, yet they are vital for career development and progression. I would like to build my presentation skills as I aim to go into data analytics, which requires one to communicate clearly and to consistently present their findings to their colleagues. Furthermore, I want to gain the skill to apply what I’ve learnt in my degree to real-life projects. ","I work well in a team because I am extremely focused and reliable, and I aim to contribute as much as I can to the group, so that we achieve the optimal outcome in a project/goal. For example, I am a part of UNSW Mathematics Society’s Events Subcommittee. Recently, we had to organise a careers-related event with 1Scope and BIS Oxford Economics, and as soon as the director in my team gave us the details on what needed to be done to run this event, I started working on it with my team members. We made sure things were completed before the stated deadline, and I always listened to input from my team to improve our event. Because we worked well together through constant communication, the event ended up being a success.
","My high school would always encourage us to become leaders of the future, in whatever path we chose once we graduated. I strongly believe I saw important qualities of leadership demonstrated by one of my teachers (T) in the way they conducted themselves inside and outside the classroom, resulting in a collaborative, supportive, and positive environment. T was clearly respected by many students and colleagues as he encouraged people to voice their ideas, and instilled the belief that everyone had the potential to do well, and that mistakes are made so people can learn from them.  Consequently, everyone was encouraged to do their best and it was evident in both the improved grades of T’s students, and from the positive feedback about the performance of the team of teachers T lead. Furthermore, the inclusion of everyone in discussions and activities were key to T’s successful leadership skills. Everyone was assured they would have their chance to contribute, and T would always actively listen to anything that was said. This challenged the archaic idea of the leader being the only one able to have control, and reinforced the concept of effective leadership and management of any groups of people. Thus, by having the opportunity to witness what true leadership looks like, it has enabled me to realise the importance of having effective leadership skills in work and life in general, and inspired me to develop these essential skills so I can use them in my future career.

After developing a broader understanding of the skills developed through the various activities and workshops run throughout the schedule, by learning about a friend’s experience with the 2017 Winter program, I realised that this was something I wanted to complete before I finished my University studies. As the program incorporates guidance by mentors, some of whom I know personally, as well as industry professionals, it allows for lesser-experienced people to bridge the gap between tertiary education and the professional workplace which I find extremely important in today’s world. ","Personally, I would like to develop the interpersonal skills between myself and others within a professional setting, specifically 1-on-1 interviews as I believe I lack confidence and the experience to articulate myself efficiently and effectively. This also leads to me wanting to develop my communication skills both written and verbal as I know this is an extremely important aspect of working within the Engineering field. Resume writing is another element I’d like to advance through the completion of this program to aid in my chances at securing a graduate position. Another key ability I would like to improve upon would be how successfully I work within a team environment and how that can shape my ability to be a leader. I believe leadership is tremendously important in real-life scenarios as someone is required to guide and allocate resources in a rightful manner for a series of goals to be acceptably accomplished. ","Being a sales associate as part of a large company I was required to be an attentive team member. I realised that having team members assigned to an individual customer during busy working periods resulted in a variety of confusion that ultimately led to customer and employee frustration. Thus, I suggested individuals be stationed at various sections of the store to streamline the process, with a few people managing the final sales procedure. If a certain area was extremely busy, I ensured that I completed all my individually assigned tasks before proactively assisting other team members and unattended customers. This worked both ways as there were situations when I was under pressure that led me to asking for the support of my fellow team members. Thus, by working together in a team, I was able to guarantee the efficacy of the overall sales process that ultimately led to an increase in profit margins for the brand.","During my second year at University I was overseeing a group project that required a hydraulic pump to be designed and manufactured to certain specifications. Unfortunately, towards the end of our project deadline, a team member had become overwhelmed with the workload and ultimately left her tasks as incomplete. I immediately scheduled a team meeting to discuss our potential strategies that would allow us to complete the assignment on time and reassured everyone that despite this setback we still had a good opportunity of delivering satisfactory results. In the end, I decided that, as a group, we would each complete a certain aspect of the remaining task, in accordance to each individual’s strengths, before coming together to put together the final product. The team highly appreciated this approach and we were able to successfully complete the project, surpassing our initial expectations. A demonstration of leadership that has had a lasting impact on myself occurred within my current workplace. The absence of my current store manager, due to illness, has resulted a full-time employee adopting the role. Over the last few weeks, tension had risen regarding a certain team member not completing allocated tasks on time as well as involving themselves in arguments with other team members. However, instead of immediately reporting the issue to dissolve any involvement with the incident, the full-timer got everyone’s individual opinion on the subject and various plans to resolve the matter. These methods were then narrowed down and discussed during a collective group meeting that she scheduled. By doing this, the full-timer was able to more effectively explain the situation to the employee in relation to their wrongdoings that resulted in a healthier working environment. Through this experience I am now able to better gauge how to manage possibly clashing personalities and to own up to the actions of people under my guidance.","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nHYXjASeLkTcJUSgGKZJZLIeyPL7jARB

Additionally, from its humble foundations as a start-up which sought to provide university students with the real skills and tools they require from a well-rounded university education, I believe that the wealth of experience derived from the simulations and personalized feedback provided as part of the program will enable me to not only enrich my professional life, but also the lives of my colleagues and friends through what I learn from this specialized learning environment.","The STEM Leaders Program markets the development of essential professional development skills such as Personal Branding and Networking skills which are crucial for any aspiring stem leader. Whilst the key to a good resume is undoubtedly the first step towards securing any job, it ultimately comes down to a genuine brand that markets your best qualities, and the communication skills that enable you to network with a wide variety of individuals from different professions that enable you to outperform the competition and lead innovation in the STEM industry. Personally, I recall that during my attendance at the EY Sweeney Speed Networking Event hosted by the UNSW Business School, a recent graduate Joyce, underscored the importance of making and maintaining solid connections with individuals to not only be an incredibly important asset for those with a future career in client services, but also highlighted the importance of a genuine brand in landing her opportunities that opened her eyes to exciting opportunities. ","As part of my role as UNSW Getting Started Project Officer during the start of this year, I was required to work with a small team to handle all incoming inquiries and manage Student ID Card lines during Orientation Week. As a consequence of changes to the system, a majority of students were required to obtain their cards during the first week, culminating in extensive lines. In order to coordinate and improve the efficiency of delivery, I consulted with the rest of the team to effectively divide ourselves into different sectors which monitored the progress of the line, from ensuring students had the correct information ready to obtain their ID card, were constantly informed of progress and approximate wait times, and that students obtained their cards at a persistent rate to minimise waiting times and delays. Ultimately, such an assignment did take an hour to improvise, but once implemented, we greatly improved the efficiency of the service by approximately 45 minutes, lessening the mean waiting times from about 2 hours from the outside of the library to 1 hour and 15 minutes.","During my previous year doing Biomedical Engineering, my first team project was an integrated internship with Stryker hosted by the University of Sydney. My team members were an eclectic mix of individuals coming from a range of backgrounds who all had brilliant and unique ideas but did not share them in group discussions regarding our project because they were not confident, or clashed with other team members. As a leader, your greatest ability is to bring out the best in others and allow them to cultivate and expand on ideas which is where I stepped up. I called the full team for meetings to discuss ideas on our project, which was to improve a price forecasting model for prosthetics. Diverging from the rigid academic atmosphere which promoted a linear approach, I divided the task of generating new ideas within a game, where each member would pretend to act as different stakeholders invested in a new project, and as chief overseer of this project, asked for their assistance on what additional functions did they believe would aid them, making it clear that it was purely a brainstorming session and that no idea was incorrect. Having assigned their roles, I gave them a period of time to research and brainstorm these stakeholders and provide suggestions for discussion in our next team meeting. Ultimately, by providing them with clear distinct roles that did not cause clashes with other team members, I was able to stimulate their creativity and enable them to flesh out their own ideas allowing for an hour of intense discussion after which we collaboratively voted on the best five suggestions with the most potential. Overall, this aided in significantly reducing conflict between team members and enabling each individual to shine with their own strengths. ",https://www.linkedin.com/in/navroy/

I'm in my second year looking to line up future opportunities, but  that initial stage of experience and opportunity to build my CV, put projects on my github and get that little bit of initial experience is something that I am definitely looking for, and the STEM leaders program really fills that need.  ","I want to apply my skills to real world problem solving, so far in my degree I've done a fair bit of work with ""assignment"" based problems, where the data sets are provided, steps are taken etc.  Going beyond that is something I really want to encounter, even if I initially am going to be behind students who are further ahead in their degrees I want to learn from failure.  ","I've generally rated myself as an excellent team player and someone who communicates well in a group setting.  In my time at university I've generally found myself as the person ""running"" my assignment groups, booking rooms and running the schedule, and I feel I've succeeded in making all of those fairly friction free.  Outside of university I spent a fairly entertaining period working in a travel agency where I was coordinating with employees in Wollongong Auckland and Sydney on a regular basis to get out our marketing projects, and despite working with quite an age range of fellow employees we all got on well.","Leadership is generally found with tackling problem solving, and my favourite example of leadership was watching my new boss at the travel agency role come in and completely change the team and the direction of the business in a matter of weeks.  For a travel agency that was pretty focused on marketing to older people and was using some very traditional marketing techniques (the catalogue was paramount) he very quickly got people to buy into the idea of change and had people who had been at the business for 30 years buy into new ideas like new service systems (after 25 years on the old one) sympathising with them and putting a framework around them of acknowledging their values and long service to make them feel part of the process.  I've always felt that's the kind of leadership I really want to do in the future, being part of making people buy into ideas and work with change.  ",CV not up to date :(

As an engineering student, I understand that my potential employers are looking for more than good grades. Therefore, I've been focusing heavily on developing soft skills by participating in a wide range of extracurricular activities on campus. I've also been searching for an external platform, where I can learn technical skills and be part of a team to solve a real-world problem. However, I find it quite difficult to seek for such opportunities as many teams/competitions/projects are highly competitive and usually require prior experience which I have yet to obtain. Therefore, I've decided to apply for STEM Leaders Program, with the aim to understand the problem-solving process of industries and how my knowledge from university can be transferred to the workforce. I hope this program can be a start of a professional development milestone in my engineering career.","Teamwork and communication are the essential skills of an engineer. However, I don’t believe we are given enough training and opportunities to effectively practice these skills at uni. I hope STEM Leaders program can provide a platform for me to learn and further strengthen my communication skills, particularly in the professional setting. Teamwork can also hugely vary from team to team, project to project as all individuals are unique and all projects have different demands. I hope this program will offer me an opportunity to work with other dedicated team members, and on a real-world issue for me to bridge that knowledge gap between university teamwork and teamwork in a professional environment. Overall, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills through this program. I believe that being exposed to people with unique perspectives and past experiences will assist me in broadening my mind and inspire me to utilise my creativity, which will in turn benefit my problem-solving skills. ","I'm a dedicated and trustworthy team player. Last year, I was part of an organising committee for 3-day Robogals AP SINE Conference at UNSW; provide training for more than 80 new executive members of Robogals from different chapters across Asia Pacific.
Being in a small team with 4, we all were required to work autonomously. As communication is critical in teamwork, I was careful in documenting all of our work processes and ensured to keep the team up to date when there was any changes. 
I oversaw booking venues, accommodation, catering, as well as recruiting volunteers. Through further discussion, my team could not only choose ideal venues, affordable accommodation and catering, but also adding on chartered bus to reduce the inconvenience of visitors taking public transport on weekends. With extra help from volunteers and friends, we managed to work together and run a successful conference; creating many memories with new friendships. ","I’ve had many opportunities where I’ve attempted a leadership role and practicing leading, encouraging, managing a team. For instance, I had to step up as a team leader once for a day of workshops with Engineers Without Borders (EWB). 
On a day with 4 classes of workshops running concurrently, the EWB team faced a shortage of team leaders as there were only 2 coordinators being assigned for the day. Equipped with experience of presenting 6 workshops previously, I volunteered to be a leader of one team.
None of the volunteers was initially willing to co-present with me. I motivated my team members to practice presenting the content individually. I guided others to act as students and asked different questions to replicate a real workshop. The practice rounds were friendly and fun. The team members gradually got familiar with the content and their confidence were boosted. Eventually volunteered to co-present with me and I assigned the other two to keeping time and facilitating activities. 
On the actual day of workshops, my co-presenter was noticeably nervous at the start but by the end of first session, he projected his voice a lot better and was much more confident. 
I also had left the facilitators to manage session 1’s activity entirely while I supervised the students; guiding them to learn to control the class. The next session was much easier and they could even start to hold conversation with students.         
Being a great leader takes a lot of practice but there can always be room for improvements. I’m determined to constantly learn to be a better leader to both others and myself.  ",https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-diem-phuong-ngo/

Coming from high school, these opportunities and experiences were not available to us and so  I really find it key to make the most out of them and take them when ever I can. ","I want to improve and gain on my social awareness and progression of the current issues that affect the wider communities abroad. Being able to effectively connect with people in order solve issues as a whole is one of the many skills I need to and want to learn. Technical skills in the field is also something that will never come unhandy. In my personal belief, all knowledge is good knowledge and so everything in the end whether it be mistakes or skills aids in progression.  ","I notice most of the times that I tend to act as the mediator of 2 sides within a group, basically finding a middle ground where all things can work out. A recent example of this occurred in my physics lab. My lab partners were split on how to do a certain task and it halted the progression of the experiment, however I was able to resolve the conflicting issue by allowing both sides to move on forward to at least get some work done while I explained as best as I could to both sides and also got  extra help from the demonstrators to explain it better to my peers and myself and only until all the questions doubts my peers had were cleared did move to answer that question. I would say I preform well in a team given a set task. ","One of the most memorable moments where I believe I positively impacted both myself and the people around me was in year 9 where I was chosen to represent my school and my religion to the interfaith conference held by the Jewish board of deputies. It was a great honour and a great leadership role which really opened me up in terms of public speaking and leadership in that I was able to effectively, respectfully and honourably able to represent my faith and my school.

4/26/2018 23:43:25,Anderson Wong,andersonwong9@hotmail.com,61401812029,4,UNSW,Bachelor of Commerce (Finance) / Information Systems,Information Technology,Facebook,"Digital innovation is introducing a digital change of some kind that builds new value to an organisation or person and therefore it is an idea that revolve around the question of “what if”. To leverage digital innovation, it is about implementing strategy to these ideas by revolving around the question of “how to”. The transition and balance between “what if” and “how to” remains to be a frustrating pursuit in many organisations and individuals. 
With a limited timing window of five to ten years for Australia’s economy to transition productively into an automation-assisted workforce, there has been a concerning lack of transparency of the unintended consequences of adapting to new technologies. As such, I am involved in investment and market research within the augmented and virtual reality industries, and more recently its effects on big data applications, medical industries and the autonomous vehicle industries, in order to identify the drivers of automation to produce commercially-driven innovation outcomes. 
This workshop will allow me to explore a new perspective of building value chains through digital innovation, and discover new opportunities from my own experiences in this fragmented transition to a digital economy. 
","Business models are changing so quickly that the time it takes to bring a new product or initiative to the market is getting shorter, and companies are unable to sustain the speed of these changes. It provides a real constant intellectual, emotional and demanding challenge that I signed up for which is continuously changing and adapting.
I have participated in the Macquarie Innovative Student Award Competition with my proposal plan to market virtual and augmented medical technologies to become the 2nd largest market leader within the Asia-Pacific region. Innovation will drive $20 trillion in global revenue growth by 2018. With these fresh perspectives that I could not see alone, I can help build the next chapter of innovation.
It is through the collaboration of many perspectives that allows you to see problems that you never knew you had. I’ve continually excelled with others in different industries, ages and cultures. Specifically, I want to be able to communicate innovative ideas that are commercially viable and sustainable, and carry through the full project management cycle of such innovative ideas that are typically in a digital environment.
","Previously as a consultant leader at a student consulting society, I had a team of six to lead a research project based on autonomous vehicles and make a recommendation. The deadline was in three weeks so it was a bit unusually short but manageable.
However, we soon found out that the deadline got moved up to two weeks which was pushing it for all that was involved. This caused sheer panic in the team and they didn’t know where to focus their energy on. Some argued the project couldn’t be done which was disheartening.
Keeping a cool mind, I divided the project into smaller manageable tasks which I then assigned according to my team members’ strengths and preferences. It got the team going instead of drifting off about the enormity of the overall project. Here’s the spreadsheets that needed to be done, you work on the macro analysis and processes. 
Open and clear communication via emails, regulator meetings and skype calls was another essential part of the project which minimised conflict. Having a computer science background in the team which was largely comprised of business students allowed me to exchange technical information on artificial intelligence to be used for the project and enhanced team productivity. From there, I combined our findings together to devise the “big picture” of the autonomous vehicle industry.
As we approached the final deadline, I found out some tasks needed to be done first before other tasks could be completed. Some of my team were waiting on others before they could start. It wasn’t a fatal flaw but at the time, the best choice was that I paired up each team member whose tasks were linked with each other so no one had to wait. 
In hindsight, I should have paid closer attention to how each part of the tasks were linked to each other and develop multiple contingency plans. Nevertheless, by re-adapting the recommendation and breaking down the objective of the project into smaller parts which were played to each members’ strengths, we devised a successful recommendation. The project manager was positively surprised given our circumstances and proved I could adapt on the fly with a team that has your back.
","I founded an education technology start-up, Project ENG, aimed to provide private tutoring services. As founder and director, I needed to develop a niche teaching strategy for our courses. There was a time where my students’ feedback suggested that our teaching strategies were lacking comparing to other tutoring companies. They said that they were learning however they lacked passion and other companies had a lot more resources and support. As a small competitor, I felt like a small spec amongst the big world and I realised we were losing students. I needed to introduce a creative change of some kind to the existing teaching strategies that we used. 
 “What-if” I could instil passion and vision for students to connect with whilst teaching? This was the innovation concept that would end up defining our teaching models. “How-to” create these moments? I realised story telling gave purpose and passion so I reached out to Pixar designers to help develop an unprecedented story-telling teaching strategy based on Pixar movies to allow students to journey into their childhood passions. It allowed two-way tutor-to-student and student-to-tutor communication as teaching no longer becomes an issue of what should be done, but a question of what will you do. 
The feedback we received initiated us to build an innovation strategy to redefine teaching which had two parts, “What-if” and “How-to” moments. “What-if” gave the conceptual change we needed to our teaching strategies but “How-to” allowed us to implement it. 
Now, our students’ feedback were positively engaging and had a spark that other tutoring companies lacked. I learnt that we couldn’t stagnate to keep up with the market. To retain and increase our students, we needed to continue improving and innovating our teaching strategies and our overall strategy. There is always room for growth and feedback.
Project ENG is my most proud innovation testament to thrive on challenges and see through to the end.

However, as I became older, I yearned for greater knowledge of the inner workings of such machinery, so I conducted my own research. When I did, I discerned the environmental damage caused by mechanical technologies. 

Spurred on by my desire to combat these issues, I completed an internship at Blue Green Engineering, a consultancy firm which helped design energy saving plans for buildings and machinery.

But I want to learn more. I believe that only the STEM Leaders Program can offer me the opportunity to learn and collaborate alongside industry leading firms and undertake projects with like-minded individuals, so that I can best fulfil my dream to help design the machines of the future.","Experience and education are two of the most valuable things you can empower young people with. Having organised community-wide workshops and industry training days for young people as the chairperson of my local youth council, I completely understand why.

The STEM Leaders Program is unique; it offers a blend of both experience and education for STEM students. From the program, I would love to learn from the experiences of mentors and industry workers. I want to use their experiences, as well as knowledge gained from professional development workshops, to ensure that I will have the best possible support network, wisdom, and skills to help design the machines of the future.

I also want to gain an invaluable insight into the workforce, so I can best gauge how to help improve the user experience of machinery, and improve the lives of all kinds of people through engineering.","It was a few weeks before the opening night of my school musical when I realised that some of my fellow cast members had lost the motivation to rehearse. It was because they felt undervalued by the principal cast members.

Due to regular interaction with both groups, I became the default pacifist. I communicated with the principals, and found that they were just too busy during rehearsals to appreciate everyone’s efforts.

I relayed this back to unhappy cast members, and I assured them that our roles were all equally vital in ensuring the musical’s success. As such, I reminded them that we all needed to contribute maximum effort for the ensemble.

Ultimately, the enthralled reaction of our audiences confirmed that the fruits of our labor were sweet. Our director also thanked me for unifying the ensemble, by raising motivation levels and ensuring we worked as an effective team once again.","Last year, my school prefects held Chrusemas, a two week series of mini-events, and the annual in-school MS Colour Run, which were both designed to raise funds for Westmead Children’s Hospital.

However, due to an administration error, we overspent on running costs for the Run. The final cost would leave us $1000 in debt. 

To recoup the loss, as the event leader, I removed all unnecessary costs. Unprofitable events were sacrificed, even if we had planned them for months in advance. It was necessary to achieve our initial goal.

I also relocated the organisational teams behind the cancelled events to help teams behind other mini-events. Affected prefects would not miss out on fundraising experience just because we had messed up our numbers.

Despite all this, we still needed to maximise sales for the Colour Run itself. With my team, I held countless lunchtime brainstorming sessions. After one late-night Skype call, I proposed to implement a group deal for Colour Run tickets.

It turned out to be an inspired decision. The two events ended up raising $2000 for the Hospital, one of the largest amounts ever raised in Prefects history. 

There is no doubt that it was a challenging experience. The preparation work coincided with my school exams, and tested my time management skills to the limit. Hindsight, however, later revealed the larger lesson behind my short-term pain; the importance of leading with selflessness. Understanding and catering for individual needs breeds happiness within team members, which was paramount to our success. In this case, it was also paramount to helping the Hospital further share happiness and care among those disadvantaged children.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XvOxOANLLBTE41-teYIdHXtR4gbDClPz/view?usp=sharing

Science (Microbiology),Civil Engineering,Friend,"I recently came across this opportunity from a friend and I am writing to express my interest in participating in this program. I believe the STEM Leaders Program is an extremely rare opportunity to experience a taste of a civil engineer’s work environment, and therefore I am more likely to be able assess my options as a future graduate more wisely. Furthermore, there seems to be a misconception, at least a popular belief amongst my peers, that technical skills are a more valuable skill set than interpersonal skills. However, I strongly believe technical skills are only half the story, having strong leadership skills is equally as important to be able to effectively communicate thoughts and ideas to ensure excellent teamwork in the work place. Therefore, by participating in this program, I hope to become more competent in both leadership and technical areas which are integral to being a successful engineer.","I hope to gain and solidify key skills needed for engineers, including both technical skills and leadership skills. Although my university has taught me various essential fundamental skills such as maths and physics, I personally feel that opportunities to exercise leadership skills are less common, and programs that emulate the real work environment are even more rare. Hence, I think this is a good opportunity to integrate myself into a work environment and practise interpersonal skills which is an integral part of leadership. As I am a 2nd year student, I have not come in contact with as many civil engineering subjects as upper year civil engineering students have and therefore resulting in less technical knowledge. I hope to gain a basic level of understanding of the key technical skills such as the software commonly used in the work place. By joining this program, I want to familiarise myself with these areas of knowledge in order to gain confidence and competency needed for later civil engineering subjects and ultimately in my future job as a civil engineer graduate. ","I currently work in a medical centre as a receptionist and I strongly believe my role aims to ensure harmony and team work is maintained in the entire practise. One of the skills I have become more competent in is knowing when to support and ask for support from my fellow colleagues. During peak hour, many patients come in large numbers to see a doctor and consequently it becomes extremely busy. Organising appointments for the patients becomes the priority, but we must make sure we do not neglect any tasks such forwarding information to the doctors and patients, as well as taking calls. Sometimes I will see my colleague struggling to complete his or her duties in a satisfactory manner due to the sheer volume of tasks needed to be completed within a short time. One example of such is when multiple phone calls ring whilst my colleague is assisting patients in large numbers, I would try my best to assist and complete tasks in their stead when they are struggling. On the flip side, if I am struggling, I will ask for assistance from my colleague. Hence effective teamwork is demonstrated where we support each other’s’ weaknesses and the tasks are able to be completed swiftly. ","During my training sessions from when I was a new receptionist, one core value my manager instilled in me was “there is no I in team”. She taught me that there are many things that can’t be done without a team, and that it is by having effective team work we can have a strong support network that complements our weakness’ and strengths. Starting out as a receptionist with no experience, I struggled in many aspects including limited medical knowledge, software knowledge and a general unfamiliarity of the environment. There had been countless times I relied on my manager to help me gain experience in my areas of weakness’ and with the little skills I had at the time, I tried my best to help my colleagues with the little knowledge I had at the time. Therefore, I believe my manager is a key leadership figure as she demonstrated effective communication skills which enable me to learn the required knowledge quickly and understand the importance of team work as a support system in the work environment. 

My managers’ effective leadership skills has inspired me to hone key skills needed in leadership.  I believe I have improved in many areas that I was lacking such as communication skills and time management which are essential areas in leadership. I take leadership in ensuring accurate information is provided to both the doctors and the patients, this may involve sending via phone calls and emails as well as knowing how to deal with difficult patients. I am also able to effectively support colleagues when they need help to ensure the tasks are done within the time limit and hence time management is demonstrated.

Therefore, I believe effective leadership inspires others’ to take on leadership roles, whether that may be taking charge of certain tasks or helping your fellow team mates out. With leadership skills gained in my work place, I am confident I can translate some of it into an engineering work place.

During high school, I was working for Cardno Ltd as an intern drafter which involves inspecting the blueprints of future car parks to prevent the scratchings of the chassis and was offered a graduate program if I choose to study civil engineering at UNSW. 
However, my interest gradually shifts towards mechanical engineering as I found my passion in the manufacturing industry, especially in machining and lathing. Thus, I am trying to expand my network in the manufacturing industry which will hopefully help me to secure an internship during university and to obtain vital experiences in manufacturing.  ","I am eager to develop my communication skills as I have realised that the engineering industry is vastly different from university. In order to solve technical problems and to convey complex ideas, good communications skills are required to ensure the successful cooperation between team members, and in some circumstances, across multiple fields, even cultures and countries. Being a bilingual myself, I believe this will greatly benefit my future careers and opens up lots of opportunities in today's globalised economy. 
Persuasion skill is also essential to handle difficult conversations and crisis communication with clients thus acting as a sound coordinator between the team and the clients, who is often recognised by the supervisors and the clients.","During middle school, I participated in the school's robotics team that aimed to compete in the national robotics competition. There, I worked on the designing of the robots which had to satisfy the competition's criteria while maximising the sensitivity of the sensors, also the part of the program which focused on servo motors. 
Such role is vital to the team's success as it coordinates the coding and designing of the robot. For example, for the old generation robots that I worked on (the robotics competition back in 2011 did not include modular robots like Lego Mindstorm), in order for the light sensor to function properly, a weighted average of the reflection indices of white and black coloured tiles had to be calculated properly.
However, the program designed by the team member required a higher sensitivity level, hence the design had to be changed accordingly. By putting more sensors risked breaking the dimension limit, so I came up with the idea of wrapping the tip of the sensor module with black tapes, thus minimising the gap between it and the ground to reduce lighting interference, which helped to increase its sensitivity and to overcome the issue. 
Due to my contribution, the teacher took notice later on and I was promoted the team leader. ","As previously mentioned, I worked as a team leader for the school robotics team comprised of 20 students. At the start of each week, I distribute every team member with coding and data collection tasks. However, in reality, only about 30% of the team actually took the competition seriously while the rest of the team only picked it as a hobby, or even a way to avoid lessons. This reduced our efficiency dramatically. Therefore, I selected 5 of the team members as core to on the programming, leaving the more linear data collection processes to the others members. 

Two months before the competition, I managed to persuade the teachers to let us leave early every Friday to work on the project and let us use the school's meeting room during the weekend. To finish the project in time, we held extensive meetings discussing our current issues and comprising appropriate solutions. 

Unfortunately, our final test clashed with the competition, and most of the students' parents were not happy with the fact that their children were not studying. Since I was fairly good at math, I actually set up a math tutorial for those who struggled with math to satisfy their parents' needs. 

A few weeks before the competition, we started to optimise the programs, also to validate out current design by letting it go through various tests. It came as a bad news when the organiser announced that more random maps will be introduced, which our programs were not compatible with. 
To overcome this, more meetings were held and the processes were streamlined into prototyping using flowcharts, coding, data collection (data needs to be manually collected before each test is run) and experimentation. 

By doing so, we managed to finish the design on time and achieved the second prize in the team competition. ",https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-ji-3ba23a163

The STEM Leaders Program would help me develop those skills and become a better engineer.,Specifically I want to improve my ability to pitch an idea to a non-engineer and communicate my goals without getting caught up in technical jargon. I also want to improve my resume-writing skills.,"I've played a lot of team sports that have helped me learn to communicate quickly and effectively with people around me, but I think my volunteering work has proven far more challenging and rewarding when it comes to teamwork. As part of my local council's environmental group, I worked to coordinate events with a team of other young people in my area. This required effective communication and delegation of tasks both through in-person meetings and online communication. As a group we were highly successful, our highest achievement being a pedal-powered cinema we organised in late 2017.","In late 2017 I suggested and helped organise a secondhand bike collection initiative at my school, which took in secondhand bikes, repaired them to the highest quality possible, and then donated them to a school for underprivileged kids in Kempsey, NSW. The aim was to provide Kempsey students with their own methods of transportation, as public transport in the area is limited, so that they could more easily get to their classes and find jobs in nearby towns. We raised funds for bike helmets and pump/repair kits and ended up donating over 25 fully repaired and cleaned bikes. Throughout this project I delegated tasks, communicated with the Kempsey school principal, and managed our progress on top of helping to clean and repair the bikes. The project was a huge success and one of my proudest high school achievements.",

With this program, I am hoping to get a better understanding of what is required of me as a potential employee for a large organisation. Furthermore, I believe that this will be an excellent opportunity to develop my soft skills, such as verbal communication and presentation skills, as well as gain a better understanding of what technical skills I am expected to possess. Overall, I would like to gain an edge over competitors when it comes to my career path. ","Overall, with this program I hope to understand more about the industry that I am heading towards and what is required of me in terms of technical skills as well as soft skills such as communication and teamwork skills. Specifically, in completing this program, I would like to improve my overall presentation skills as I feel as this is one of my weaker skills, especially when there is limited time to prepare the content to my level of satisfaction. Furthermore, I hope to gain more of an understanding into the professional environment and what is required of me in this setting. ","For a Manufacturing and Design project, I was with a competent group with a leader that was driven and highly skilled. Our task was to design and manufacture a pneumatic pump as well as produce a design report, outlining the specifications and design process for each component. Towards the end of the project the team leader became overwhelmed at the amount of work that had been delegated to other members, but had not been completed yet. I as well as one other team member, pitched in to help complete the work from other peoples sections as well as put the report together. In the end, it was a stressful home stretch but we managed to successfully submit our report by creating a supportive and encouraging environment to help each other with our tasks. ","For a group report on an ethics case study, with a team of eight people, I oversaw the splitting up of the task into smaller roles and delegating tasks to smaller groups within the team and setting deadlines for each section.  As it was a major research project that encompassed several weeks, it was evident that the standard of work was varying across the team. Also within the smaller groups there were issues with the dynamic and amount of work each individual was doing. When I became aware of the issues, I approached each of the smaller groups separately as well as some individuals to ensure that everyone was on the same page as well as identifying the problems that they were facing. In many cases, these were solved with adequate communication as well as ensuring that everyone felt supported and had an environment in which they could ask for help. In the end, I compiled the sections of the report as well as smoothed out the style and incorporated more research references. Ultimately, the report was completed to a high standard and all the issues in the team dynamic were resolved. I learned many lessons in the dynamics of a team and how I can handle these better. Overall, I believe that each member of the team walked away from the project with a positive attitude.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jKMOXiqqend1Hul6zb8oef9t69Mqvh25/view?usp=sharing

I believe it will teach me how to apply the culmination of knowledge I have obtained at university to real world prospects and further my confidence and core skills so that I may pursue greater ambitions of launching my own start up. ","The specific skills that I look forward to working on would be in general understanding how the biomedical industry actually operates, understanding in which areas it thrives, and which areas still have been yet to be explored, possibly providing the perfect entry point for a start up venture. I also look forward to understanding how to better market ideas and projects in order to receive general support and funding. ","I see myself as having the ability to strongly work within a team as I find it natural to engage with multiple people to get difficult tasks done. Currently I am involved within the UNSW Sunswift Solar Racing team, which contains 30 students working together towards the advent of constructing a reliable solar sedan. Being with this team for the last six months has allowed me to develop a greater understanding of the design and implementation life cycle for real world engineering projects, and how such large tasks can only be completed through extensive teamwork. On one occasion I attempted to pitch one of my design solutions to fellow team members for approval and consequent implementation. However due to the highly technical nature of my pitch, many members were left confused about certain components. This experience really enlightened my perspective on the importance of teamwork and simple communication, thus allowing me to adapt my approach and communicate far more effectively in all future presentations.","There are times where I have both observed and demonstrated strong leadership skills in order to get tasks done. During my time as part of the UNSW Sunswift Solar Racing team, I have observed numerous occasions where our project manager has gone above and beyond to contribute to the operation of the team. One reoccurring notion is that our project leader never puts himself above any task including menial responsibilities such as reorganising the workshop or cleaning the solar array on the vehicle. His ability to contribute to any task that needs to be completed no matter what its level of importance has definitely inspired fellow team members, including myself to also try dedicate ourselves as much as he has for the team’s mission. Personally I have also demonstrated leadership within my time at Sunswift whilst being the lead designer for a specific component of the car. Several occasions have arisen where members of other sub-teams within Sunswift have had difficulty completing their designated tasks, due to a lack of knowledge or experience. Although being assigned with my own specific component to work on, when fellow team members struggle with tasks that I may be experienced in, I always ensure to assist them to ensure that construction of the vehicle is not delayed. Although I provide assistance, I do ensure that the members I assist become completely capable of handling that task if it were to arise in future, allowing them to also train future members who may also struggle with that particular task.

Thus, in my final year, my goal is to seek more opportunity to help me improve my professional working skills, in communication, teamwork skills, leadership skills and also networking. I believe no one is ever gonna be ready to enter a new milestone in life, moving from uni life to working life for example. Thus, I want to prepare myself with seeking more opportunity to grow more. My friend told me that STEM program has changed him in a way, help him preparing entering his new milestone. Therefore, I want to apply for STEM leader program. Also, I’m curious on how the skills I learnt until now will be applied to solve real problems. Also, I believe networking is a crucial thing when we’re about to enter work life. ","Aside frome I believe this program will improve my resume, I believe this opportunity with help my personal growth as a person. I believe being part of this program will help me to be more confidence and knowledgable. After being part of this program, I want myself to be more confidence in entering work life, to gain more networking, to be able to be more confidence to presenting my ideas and opinions and be able to be more critical in giving ideas and opinions. Also, I want to improve my communication skills, as I believe working in a team and presenting our ideas will be a really great way to polish someone in improving his communication skills. And throughout 2 years of uni, I have met various kind of people in university, I would like to have more networkings before entering work life. ","I believe, I work well in a team. I always think being in a team solving a problem is much more efficient while solving alone. Sometimes, I take the role to plan out on how we will approach the assignment or the problem. One of my experiences working in a team is when I had internship in one of insurance companies. During the internship program, me and 3 other interns were given a final project on how to improve the digital marketing in the company. It was pretty tough since we are all actuarial students and had minim knowledge about marketing also it was the first time we met. But through out the preparation, we managed to work wit other division in the company and present our ideas well to our CEO and CFO. This is when I think I work well with new people to achieve the same goal. "," The opportunity when I had the chance to demonstrated leadership is when I became a creative director of Indonesian Night Market, an event from Indonesian students to promote Indonesian culture and celebration for those who miss their home. It was a delightful opportunity. As a creative director I worked with 3 teams : marketing, design and decoration. This opportunity has allowed me to be more confidence and knowledgable on how to work as a leader, how to work under pressure because deadlines were pretty tight, also learn not to be panic when problem arises, to not taking things personally when working in a team, learn how to being considerate and tolerable as we are a team who are aiming for one goal. This experience has positively impacted my way on solving problem, on how to look at a big picture of a proble, and interact with my team in a professional but not in a superior way as their leader. Moreover, I feel that this opportunity has improved my confidence as being a director I have to be able to lead a meeting. Also, I learned how to deal with various kind of teammate, how to work under my project manager and being responsible of my team’s performance. This experience has taught me to be more confidence to speak up my mind while allowing myself to listen to other’s opinion, although becoming a director I seemly have more power on my opinion, I learned that every decision is better when made and decided in discussion. And I believe as this opportunity has positively changed me in a way, this is also a positive influence to people around me, as not only I gained experience, my attitude on working with others also changed.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bbOISUDAGy6XsyNR8CYDBRVz3hHoikQU

From what I have seen, the STEM Leaders Program provides a great opportunity to expand and enhance skills that are valuable outside of University; in the real world and opens up many opportunities for those involved. As someone who is always looking to improve myself and eager to learn and undertake new challenges, I have decided to apply for the STEM Leaders Program because I want to connect with people who have common aspirations being in this program like myself.","There are a range of skills I want to gain from the STEM Leaders Program - most notably:
- Automation/AI
- Soft/Hardware Skills
- Interview/Industry Techniques
- Real Skills for the Workforce
- Innovative Thinking
- Project Management
- Collaborative Work
- Interpersonal Communication","I think I perform extremely well as a team, usually solidifying myself as a core member/leader unit who both contributes and facilitates working towards a common goal. An example of this is during my first year course project for ENGG1000, where we as a team agreed to divide the workload evenly. However, due to unfortunate circumstances and conflicting commitments, some members were unable to meet their given duties. To resolve this, the remaining members including myself decided to work together and finish the incomplete task at hand. By communicating effectively and working well together, we were able to develop a successful product for submission.","An instance where I realised I needed to step up was for MMAN2100, where my team was lacking in certain areas and not contributing enough to the team. As such, I put it on myself to prepare and facilitate work for each team member based on their level of commitment to the project. To successfully meet deadlines and submit work to the best of our abilities, I remained in constant communication with all the team members, reminding them of the tasks at hand and upcoming deadlines that had to be met. In addition, for those who were behind in the course content I drafted up a quick summaries for them each week so they could easily understand what was required of them. At certain points during the project there were times where members were not meeting their quota and contributing their share. As a result I put it upon myself to put in more time and complete their assigned work and gave them other chances to make up for their lack of effort. Due to my consistent work-ethic and leadership, the team was able to successfully submit a project that did well in the final submission. As well as this, certain members of the team were inspired and also took it upon themselves to dedicate more time and effort to produce higher quality work.","CV: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKcTViMJGfUaC4r1c0oieVZxy1c5CAso/view?usp=sharing

Currently, I feel lacking in some areas of presenting myself to an employer and some social skills and I strongly believe the 5 day course program will help me improve on my weakness and hone my strengths as a student in university.

Also, I wanted to apply for this program to give myself a clearer vision of life after university, what career /industry I would like to apply for by undertaking team projects in a work-safe environment. I hope that through this unique opportunity it will help me discover new passions in the field of engineering, in particular the commerce side of engineering firms.","The specific skills i would like to develop in particular are my professional development skills. I often find it hard to write CVs and creating the perfect resume suited to employers, and i hope through this program i am able to better myself at doing this. In addition, I have not yet created a LinkedIn profile and i hope that this program can give me advice and give myself a start at creating one for the near future.

In addition, i would like to improve my skills at socialising with others, not only with professionals but students too. I would like to present myself in a more confident manner. Through the program and team activities, I'd not only like to develop my social skills but my teamwork and analytical skills to help assist myself for work in University and beyond.  ","I think I work very well in a team, I always try taking the initiative to reach out and communicate to other team members to share the load of the work. I'd always try to make friends with my team members first and understand them before working as a team. As a team, I'd focus on the most efficient and fair way to approach a situation well before the deadline to avoid stress. 

One example of working as a team was in university for my ENGG1000 project, constantly throughout the semester there was work split between the 6 of us. We'd organise a team leader to set aside work for each member. For me, when i was assigned a task I would always plan out my section before starting , this included me talking with team members to get a brief idea of what they are all expecting of me. Then, I would complete the work much ahead of time which allows me to proof-read and give feedback on other peoples work and compile the work together. Through this work ethic, we breezed through the ENGG1000 project while still having fun in socialising in our meetings as we had little to stress about.","Leadership has honestly life around, ever since I was young i was a quiet and shy person, however through sport I found passion in basketball and exercising. Through this experience of playing sport and developing skills, I progressed to a high enough level in my team where I was promoted the position of captain. This position was very daunting for me as not only I was bad at speeches, I didn't  feel confident to lead others. However, overtime and after every weekend we trained together and then played competition, I slowly eased into my position. I started to encourage my team, have the motivation to plan strategies for my team to learn, and lastly be more vocal and confident. I eventually became the anchor of the team and be a role model to help people. Through sport, I was presented an opportunity I didn't think I'd get, leadership. Becoming a leader of a team helped me improved my interpersonal skills and confidence through adolescence, and eventually my efforts of training, encouraging and playing with others amounted to winning our local competition and making good friends that still last today. The confidence I got from this then lead me to undertake more programs such as Sports captain and camp leaders to experience the joy of leading people.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/9d67mr615dfybmb/Willkie_Huang_CV.docx?dl=0

But it wasn’t until I read posts on Facebook and LinkedIn when I really got excited and immersed myself in the spirit of what you guys do. It is amazing how an organization for students, Real Skills have created a platform where student are given relentless support through knowledge, network and skills necessary to succeed in the evolving STEM industry. 

I think it is about, about creating enablers, creating innovators, creating disrupters, creating a generation which embraces change at every turn, every corner. It is not about creating likeminded people but a bunch which think so far outside the box that they pave a new path for the generations to come. This is exactly what Real skills have done through their STEM Leader Program. I want to be part of this forward thinking, ever growing community where entrepreneurship, innovation and passion are all around me at all times of the day. 
","At the UNSW Hero’s program, a lot of the speakers have been telling me that networking is the most important thing of all, “it is not what you know, but who you know” and I think I would definitely be able to branch out my network in this amazing space. I want to be constantly learning new things and experimenting new things. I want to be constantly growing as a person and continue to meet some amazing people and really make a lasting impact.","Successful teamwork relies heavily on clear communication, adequate individual contribution and a positive work ethic. I think that a good team member not only has the skills to listen to everyone as well be effective but to also sympathise with the person they are talking to. I recently did the UNSW hero’s program, and I think that was one of my favourite teamwork experiences. I think we all worked really well to come up with the final solution and a presentation. I think we really listened to everyone and respected everyone’s opinions. I think I worked well as part of the team because I was not only able to listen to my team members opinions but also contribute mine through a non-criticism manner. I think I was able to include everyone in the team, the people who didn’t speak to much and people who did speak too much, I think i was able to mediate the conversations to have an effective output. ","To me leadership is not only about managing others and making tough decisions but it is about inspiring those around me. Connecting and empathising with individuals is what makes a great leader. A leader is someone who has the ability to communicate a vision and translate that vision into a reality. As an Innovation Community Officer at UNSW, I had the amazing opportunity to organise The Maker Games. One of the obstacles our team faced on that was the slides didn’t work and we had to suddenly move everything to a new venue. Even though I wasn’t the event lead for the event, I stepped up to the challenge of where I really took control of the situation by delegating tasks and talking to everyone about what is happening so no one was left in the dark. I stayed calm throughout the whole situation which really reflected on the team around me. I think that is probably one of the most important things I have learned, staying calm and focusing on the task ahead.","Resume:

1)    Real world project
Although I love civil engineering and have been studying civil engineering for more than 3 years, I still always have the confusion that what civil engineering is really about in the real world. SLP provides us with a great opportunity to have a closer look into the industry and reflect the path we've taken. 

2)    Challenging
I enjoy challenges. I believe that the more it challenges, the more you learn from it.

3)    Meet likely-mind people
Life is a one-way journey that never goes backward and the only way to live out of our own personal experiences is to talk to others and learn from their experiences. 

I am keen to be part of SLP to take the invaluable challenges.
","1)    Industry experiences
As mentioned in the first question, I'd like to gain a better understanding of what kind of skills or ability that companies are looking for. And based on that, I can improve my career developing plan to better fit the career market.

2)    Problem-solving & working well under deadline
 Through working on a real-world problem within 5 days, I believe I will have the chance to enhance my problem-solving skills.

3)    Leadership and interpersonal skills
There is not a single formula for leadership and interpersonal skills. By meeting different people, I am willing to adjust my approaching methods and gain more experience of teamwork.
"," I am part of CEVSOC international team. Our team recently have been running the CEVBuddy Mentoring Program since March. And I believe I demonstrated strong teamwork skills in following aspects:
1)    Excellent communication skills: 
Shown strong communication skills (both oral communication and written communication )by acting as a conduit among mentees, mentors and the team manager.
2)    Creative: 
Came up with new ideas for bonding games to encourage the interaction between mentor and mentees on both CEVBuddy Welcoming Night and catch-up session. And received good feedback on both activities.
3)    Problem-solving skills: 
Successfully prioritized tasks for our events, tasks including pre-event promotion, registration, logistics and event set-up and general organization, assisted and facilitated events for other teams as well.","I am also an International Student Ambassador of Discussion Group, Student Development International.
Talking about one time I demonstrated leadership, I have to mention my experience in the Discussion Group which is a program run everyday classes for international students who speak English as a second language. 
Students that come to the Discussion Group always have a good intention to practice oral English. However, most of them are afraid of saying something wrong so they tend to listen rather than speak out. As a leader, I understand but it is not the best way to learn oral English. What I did to assist these students are including:
1)    Broke into a smaller group so that they will have more time to express themselves.
2)    Invited/Asked students who speak less in the group, be patient with their answer and encourage them to say more next time by giving compliments.
3)    Ask for feedback and their suggestions, and sincerely sharing my experience of how I learned English.
I witness many of them have transferred from who are shy, scared of speak up in class to confident, fluent and great communicators.
I think the best part of my leadership experiences is that it always is a win-win situation. Not only students are gaining, I also have more confident in leading people and public speaking. Like I said in the first question, the most efficient way to learn would never be learning alone, it is to learn from others.",www.linkedin.com/in/xianrong-sheena-cai

I’d further like to develop my resume, networking, presentation, interview and networking skills. I believe STEM Leaders is a valuable program to allow me to gain these skills in a supportive and encouraging environment.
","I enjoy being part of teams and work well in a team. One such example is at a past hackathon I attended. I collaborated with my team to choose an idea and build the project. I believe I worked well because I encouraged the positive qualities of my friends such as their persistence, creativity and critical thinking. I was non-judgemental which prompted my friends to openly share their ideas. I was polite in my communication when I disagreed and spoke in such a manner so as to motivate them to discuss any feelings. Our communication was transparent and because we were honest and sincere with each other, we were able to cooperate effectively and work well. Being a team member is about uplifting each others strengths, and not discrediting their weaknesses. It is about overcoming the weakness using each other’s strengths, and building up the team to perform to their best potential. ","
I established a yoga club in my school. My peers at school were extremely distressed due to the pressures of academics and adolescence. I had attended a workshop about yoga in India before and I recalled the profound benefits of yoga for becoming calm, centred and in improving heath, memory and concentration. I decided to introduce my school friends to yoga and I initiated yoga club. I formed a team of 6 other leaders and we collaborated and work together to establish yoga club. We designed posters and invited our friends to attend class. Yoga club started with weekly yoga videos and while they were helpful, they were not as effective as we wanted yoga club to be. We wanted something more engaging and exciting, a class where students could bond and get to know each other as well. Hence, researched on the internet and contacted a company in the United States, called ‘Yoga 4 Classrooms’. They graciously donated an online yoga course and a pack of fun yoga cards that illustrated yoga poses with group challenges. The leaders and members of the club took turns teaching using the hilarious cards, and the club was effective in building a sense of community and combating stress positively in our school.

I believe it offers a great opportunity to also connect with other engineers and help with communication which I believe is the most important skill when it comes to engineering. Although I had a taste of handling situations which engineers would come across in the real world in High School and ENGG1000 I believe this offers a different type in which you aren’t walked through and shown what to do.,"The skills I want to gain are innovation, effective communication as well as effective presentation.

I believe that this program will aid my career development by giving me skills that most graduates would not have.",I believe I work very well as a team. Being part of a small engineering firm has allowed me to perfect working with other members and helping them express themselves and their ideas. If no immediate leader steps forward I like to put myself into the position and encourage others. Even though I may not have the knowledge that others do I still get them to express themselves and also explain it as it may be beneficial to the team and will allow me to learn and others to critique their idea making way for an even better one.,"I have both seen and demonstrated leadership in many different situations. I have demonstrated leadership throughout all the years at my school and even in University. I believe my most profound moment of leadership which I hope positively impacted those around me was when I was on a Duke of Edinburgh hike in which the student navigating had got us lost. Using my leadership skills and navigation skills which I had learnt throughout my life, I took charge of the situation and safely navigated my team to safety even teaching the navigator for next time. I believe a leader should not take 100% command on a situation but should guide others towards a goal and step in when he/she sees fit. I like to use the analogy that a leader should be like a lighthouse where others can navigate their own way because of you. In my ENGG1000 project I have taken this approach and have been extremely successful with my team being extremely productive.

A project that particularly stood out for me was ENGG1000. Our task was to design a wooden prototype for a building to a high level of standard and also within a certain deadline. Each team member had differing opinions and ideas about how to approach the assignment. Due to the lack of cohesion in the group, it was difficult to progress further and develop ideas in the assignment. In a team, I tend to value my team member’s ideas as well, and hence I took the initiative and proposed a solution that incorporated the opinions of my other team mates while also providing an optimal design. The team members did not feel as if I was overpowering but took time to appreciate my efforts. As an outcome, our team was able to deliver the assignment within the deadline and also receive recognition for our innovative design for our building. The reason to why we worked well was because, I temporarily acted as a leader who guided my team through steps. My team cooperated much more effectively when they knew their opinions were being considered and valued.","In the context of my part time job at a sushi bar in a shopping mall, there was an instance in which the store flooded with customers during lunch time. As it is a small sushi bar, there was only one person serving the customers and thus we were having a difficult time handling the overwhelming situation. As a quick response, I, who was assigned to preparing sushi at that time, took the lead to delegate some of my tasks to other workers, in order to help the only server and handle the state of chaos. It was important that I did not abandon my duties as it meant that there would be no more production of sushi for the customers. Thus instead, I initiated a plan in which we were able to ensure enough sushi was being produced and the customers were also being served in a timely manner. Through the clear communication between the other server and me, and the cooperation of the other kitchen staff we were able to overcome the pressure. Therefore, through this effective teamwork, we were efficiently able to serve the customers in a satisfactory manner and also complete the required tasks at the same time.  This not only positively impacted the customers but also ensured the smooth running of the sushi bar whilst retaining maximum profits.  ",https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishma-pradhan-73671994/

I understand that currently, i am not best i can be and i wish to reach closer to that milestone through the help of the STEM leaders Program.","I simply wish to further improve my leadership skills, in my time at Sydney High Rowing i was surrounded by leaders, my Captain of Boats in 2016 was an aspiration to me, without actively seeking leadership, it naturally came to him, always. The rowers did not follow him because he asked, but becuase he made us want to. That is the leader i want to be, not a leader by name but a true leader.","I work very well in teams, rowing is without a doubt a team sport, requiring the teamwork and synchronization of peers to a level matched by none. Without teamwork, the rowers fall out of sync and the boat becomes a complete mess. i've spent the vast majority of my recent years rowing ","Leadership does not culminate in a single experience, it is a lifestyle that earns the respect of your peers. The Captain of Boats I talked about above was the embodiment of that, he never bragged or used his authority, he simply asked and it was done. When times were tough and everyone around him wanted to give up, he tried harder than ever and empowered those around him. When we were fatigued, tired, ready to give up, the rest of us watched and he gave us hope and willpower. Similarly in 2017, I was elected as Captain of Boats and tried to mimic his leadership, but the situation was different and I had to adapt. A new coach was introduced to us, whos technical choices were almost the complete opposite of our previous coach. Many rowers disagreed with the new coach and did not trust his judgement, myself included, however I belive it is better to work together to reach the best possible outcome than to argue and fight, afterall teamwork involves compromises, you do not always get what you want. I convinced my peers to respect the position of the coach and to try his technical preferences. Although this did not work out for us, I believe i made the right choice and at the very least I learned from my experience,",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sCRreOtHYAsTwsPOW-XvuFMkjpdIqXGw

But I really do not know how to apply those theories I learnt to the real life engineering tasks. Also, I have been taught how to use CAD to present my design, but I really lack the knowledge of how to determine my design to be realistic or not. STEM leaders program let me feel it is a chance where I could learn how I could apply those theoretical knowledge to real life challenges.  ","Resume writing, practice skills in engineering problems, abilities to communicate and coordinate the program, team work and so on.","I think I have the abilities to communicate well and coordinate with the pace of other team members. I had enrolled in two engineering design courses, and for both of the projects, I had work with my team members pretty good. I love communicating with people, therefore I would like to coordinate the different paces of members. For example, I had a project the whole team of mine should design and manufacture a pump within a specific time. I did a really good job in managing our time in respect to the project deadline. When a member could not finish his task within time, I would ask for reasons, and try to coordinate it and do some tiny adjustments in case this would affect our whole program.","Recently I joined the UNSW student-led project - Sunswift, the solar car programs. It really shocked me when I first saw how this project runs. The project manager was so inspiring and organized to run such a big team. All project discussion was conducted on SLACK, and every task was posted on confluence, which functioned as a common knowledge base for both new members and older members. I really appreciate the whole functioning of the whole project and look forward for the chances to train myself to have the abilities to lead.",Sorry found this link very intense to the deadline.

I am passionate about applying the knowledge I have gained through my degree towards improving the environment around me and the chance to work on a real life STEM Project excites me. Further, I hope to meet other like-minded people that I can learn from and work with to achieve a successful result and grow personally and professionally. The chance to interact with professionals from prominent companies was also a motivating factor for me applying, since I feel it is only through this exposure that I can learn what industry and positions I would like to go into. ","I hope to develop and gain a variety of personal, interpersonal and professional skills from this program that would aid in my career development. Through the project and development workshops I hope to improve my problem solving skills and learn new approaches to achieve successful results. Further, I would like to build on my currently leadership skills, particularly for a more professional environment. Additionally, I think through working in a group on a project, I can improve on many technical skills that other team members may have at a higher level than I do. For career development, I believe networking and building a personal brand is important and I hope to improve these skills through the program as well.","I believe I work extremely well in a team and have worked in many teams, ranging from within a community youth group, university society and of course university group work within subjects. Last year, I was part of the Women in Engineering’s Industry Mentoring Program team. There were 4 members; two directors and two sub-committee members of which I was one. We organised 5 events throughout the year as well as continued correspondence with over 100 participants. We met weekly and each had individual responsibilities as well as collaborative tasks that we had to complete. I ensured my tasks were completed to a high level in time and when working with others collaborated well to make sure everyone contributed and the result was combined effort. I believe I work well in a team because I can take lead when its required but am also comfortable supporting and following other’s instructions.  ","During the Industry Mentoring Program I mentioned in the previous question, I witnessed many professionals, males and females, standing up as leaders to be role models to students. Each were giving up their time to mentor students in order to share their experiences to ensure further progress gets made with gender equality in the field. Their contribution positively impacted the 50 students that were a part of the program as well as the greater butterfly effect that will have. This inspired me to try stand up and contribute to causes I am passionate about, taking the initiative to attend Robogals and Engineers Without Borders events and contribute to their volunteering opportunities.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pROHw33LYyUXfzRm_fpsBz714MDinwNm

Initially I wasn't the leader, however as time progressed, I've noticed that the leader became more uninterested and wasn't leading the team anymore. The team morale decreased, resulting in no progress in our project for a week. I decided to take initiative, thoroughly understanding the requirements, our current progress and organising it to ensure that tasks could be allocated for their preferences/strengths and incase everyone had no preference. I also produced a Gantt chart to help visualise our timeframe, accounting for some slack time.

Many people around me, including myself, have been 'lost' in how to begin to assess and confidently enter the industry, and the STEM Leaders Program appears to be a helpful gateway to do so. I want to build real life experience hands-on and develop my professional and technical skills so that I can better apply myself as I pursue my career and work to become a leader in the industry. I also love networking, so I'm always really keen and humbled to receive mentoring and making great, genuine connections.  "," I'm very eager to learn and build on from the experience and interpersonal skills I already have, as well as learn new skills. I would love to learn how I can differentiate myself from other candidates through resume, personal branding and interview skills - how do I effectively communicate what I want to offer. I'd also like to build my professional and technical skills which would be desirable and applicable in the industry e.g. presentation, programming languages, design, strategy-making and problem-solving. ","My experience in participating in agile team sprints and facilitating discussion as an IT subcommittee member of the charity society Project Hope has been extremely rewarding. Unlike other committees, the IT subcommittee has to be proactive in coming up with our own tasks and making improvements the website, as we are not driven by events or time. We listen to everyone's ideas/vision and work together to organise tasks and meet deadlines we set for ourselves. I recognise that we are part of the larger team of Project Hope, so I always look out for ways to collaborate with other committees and make their job easier e.g. promoting current sponsors on the website to attract new ones for the sponsorship committee. I believe that I work well as part of a team because of my proactive and optimistic nature and my eagerness to learn and help others whenever possible. ","As an executive member of the NFP Project-Unwritten, I had the pleasure of facilitating our first international volunteering mission 'Cambodia-Unwritten' last year. With my team, I led a group of volunteers to execute educational and motivational workshops at three different schools. We aimed to not only improve the students' language skills and financial literacy, but also to inspire them to overcome difficulties and continue to pursue their passion as future leaders, engineers, designers etc.

Even at the most tiring and draining of times, my enthusiasm and motivation did not wane. I made sure that I was encouraging and hustling with the team, keeping morale high and our vision at the forefront of our minds. I noticed the importance of using my leadership position to empower others (both students and volunteers) so that they can develop their character and skills e.g. improving/adjusting the content and delivery of workshops every night and during the lesson to improve leaders' and students' experiences. I believe that I am an understanding and flexible person who can effectively communicate with others, so my ability to effectively solve problems, make quick decisions, and defuse/mediate conflicts was important in promoting discussion and overcoming setbacks. 

I also observed the positive impact of the leadership of others. Both volunteers and fellow leaders showed great confidence in taking on this immense challenge. We fed off each other's hard work and commitment, all cooperating to engage, lead and inspire these youths. It was amazing to see the positive impact of our actions and leadership as the students got really involved  in our workshops, and left eager to incorporate what they've learnt into their daily lives. I am truly grateful for this experience, as I feel that we made a great impact on the students and participants of Cambodia-Unwritten.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivian-lai-922688158

I believe the STEM Leaders Program, given its professional yet friendly culture dedicated to empowering fellow engineers, is therefore a fantastic opportunity for me to give back to my peers and make friends. I hope to gain invaluable experience and accelerate my personal development, and at the end, be able to look back knowing I made a difference. Being a STEM leader is a coalescence of two elements: problem solving and teamwork. It allows knowledge accumulated through university to be applied into real life case studies, which enhances my learning of how engineers work together to solve problems. By joining, I seek the opportunity provided by RSE to make develop my interpersonal skills and make a positive impact on those around me. ","By joining STEM Leaders, I hope to develop my set of interpersonal and communication skills gained through work and university and apply them in a team environment. I believe my confidence can be built upon in various areas, especially in leadership positions. By doing this, I hope to be able to guide a team of individuals who are all oriented on the same goal to gain insight into the industry of engineering and the work that they do. Presentation skills are also fundamental in every aspect of life – by participating in the program I would like my verbal and gestural presentation skills to be greatly improved on, and to effectively articulate my ideas to others. I want to gain networking skills in building rapport with company representatives and graduates, learning how to successfully negotiate with them and inquire about the culture of the work they do. ","During high school, I captained the 2nd grade badminton team that played against other schools. At the start of the season, it was difficult for me to adjust myself into a teamwork-oriented group since most of the players wanted to win rather than gain experience in competing against different players. Hence, I used a friendly and insightful approach to deal with players who were struggling to find their rhythm and boosted morale during the matches. Throughout the season, I got to work with the team during training and doubles matches, brainstorming strategies with them and encouraging everyone to contribute ideas. The season had many highs and lows, but at the end, I had managed to build upon each member’s team mentality and their ability to complement their strengths with another player’s weaknesses. Participating in a team environment allowed us to ultimately win the Premierships and take home the title. ","A difficult problem arose in my school’s annual Athletics’ Carnival in Year 12. Being a House Captain, I had to work with my fellow Vice House Captain to organise the relay teams for the final event. The main problem was that on the day, the events were running late with many of the students not sitting in their respective House columns at the stadium. We were constrained by time, but did not want to upset the competitors and spectators. Being the leader and taking the initiative, I suggested to the head sports teacher that we should omit the events which would have less participants in it and that could be undertaken at school, such as the 800 metres jog which that consistently had a smaller pool of competitors. I also requested that the relay team orders be read out over the microphone so the students would know they were part of the relay team. This proved to be a better way of organising the event, and consequently the event finished on time. We received positive feedback on how the event was run, as every year the carnival would run overtime and many of the events would be cancelled. This was unfair for many of the students who were looking forward to participating in those events that were held once a year, leading to complaints from unsatisfied students. Reflecting back on this, I think the on-the-spot decision we had analogously agreed upon was the right choice, heightening my experience in problem solving.

Reading about the STEM Leaders Program really gave me insight on the extent at which the program can help me reach my potential to be a workplace professional. During my first year at university, my primary goal was to settle in. As a second year, I feel a lot more comfortable and confident with my university life, which gives me an opportunity to now experience industrial and professional environments. I believe that the skills I need to progress in such environments and improve on my personal, such as communication, networking, teamwork and leadership skills, can be developed in the STEM Leaders Program. ","To aid in my career development, I believe I need to hone in on my leadership, time management and technical skills as well as maintaining a positive mind set. There have been many opportunities in my school and personal life where I have had to work in a team. There have been many instances where I have opted to ‘follow’ rather than ‘lead’. I possess time management and technical skills however my goal is still to improve upon them and applying for this program can help me refine those skills. Something that I have struggled with before, is taking failure personally and not being able to move forward from it. While this is something I have been working on overcoming for quite some time, there is room for me to improve. I believe this program will help me improve on skills I lack, and enhance the skills I already possess. ","I believe I work efficiently in a group situation, by being proactive and doing my share of the workload to my highest ability. An example of when I worked in a team effectively was when I helped organise a blood-drive. Between five members, we delegated various tasks, depending on the individual's skills and preferences, such as advertising, booking donation sessions, hiring buses, health briefing sessions etc. We met fortnightly to discuss the progress we made on our assigned tasks. We knew that in order to work cohesively as a team, everyone had an achievable goal to work on individually. My tasks were to create expression of interest surveys to distribute around the school, as well as give a briefing to the enthusiasts to explain the health requirements needed for donation. I worked well as part of a team as my tasks were completed as required, leading to a successful blood-drive.","An example of a time where I demonstrated leadership was when I was volunteering at university. I am a part of a volunteering organisation called Phil’, that raises money for the Sydney Children’s Hospital’s Child Life and Music Therapy ward by holding many events both inside and outside the university community. I joined prior to most other people, allowing me to get the experience and confidence to approach people in talking about the cause we raise money for. I was guided by the main program coordinator in how I should approach people nicely and confidently. When new recruits were brought in, they were assigned to a shift where there was a previously experienced member. My shift time was quite popular so I was assigned two new recruits instead of one. Both of them were quite nervous as they hadn’t had any experience in approaching people and making conversation with strangers, which is quite a daunting feat. I had to assume the ‘leader’ position to help them ease into their tasks. I initially gave them some tips that I was taught by the program coordinator, such as engage in a friendly conversation starters, introduce the activity we are doing, as well as inform them about our organisation and where the money goes to. Once they understood them, I demonstrated to them what I explained. After approaching a few groups, I gave them the chance to take initiative with approaching people. I gave them constructive comments on how they could improve the next time. Rude responses and rejection lowered their confidence so it was my job to pick them back up again. After a few times each I suggested to both of them that we should alternate turns approaching people. This positively impacted the efficiency of our task helped both of my team mates gain confidence in themselves.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skr22YrEp0LxHj-W2Hb_AQT8bPfBr9D883vbUTqT9q8/edit?usp=sharing

The biggest advantage of this program is the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the industry leaders that are not only limited to a single engineering degree. It  allows students to explore the wide range of career options available in the STEM industry today. Working along side with an industry leader us does not only show us their methods of influence that have motivated and led others, they can also help pinpoint our strengths and weaknesses to improve on to grow our potential to become better leaders in ourselves and to others. 
The activities in the STEM Leaders Program will help students practise our collaborative skills. It is chance for students to apply their innovative thinking in problem solving and provides the challenge of working as teams to turn the ideas into reality. This can involve practising communications in engaging with team members to put ideas together and to communicate professionally when delivering the vision or idea to an industry leader or to external clients of a company. 
","I would like to gain the flexibility skills as a leader from the STEM Leader Program. Being able to adapt to new situations and overcome new obstacles is an important skill that I encounter in many team work situations. Moreover, developing a flexible and open mindset is essential as the engineering industry is rapidly changing today and constantly requires a shift in strategies of getting a job done. 
Another skill I would like to gain from the STEM Leader Program is to communicate more professionally and effectively.  I would like to learn to present my ideas in a more confident and succinct manner that can showcase my skills and abilities to my potential employers. When working with others as a team, it is important to be able to understand the viewpoints of others as it can always lead a better understand in solving a problem as a team. Hence This program provides a great platform to practice this skill as it involves students from different engineering streams to connect and share ideas with one another in team works.

I perform well as part of a team and this is seen commonly in my part time job as a customer service assistant role at KFC Australia. During busy business hours, working well with teammates is essential to deliver the most efficient customer service. When working as partners with a colleague, we split the job tasks and alternate between role of serving the customer and packing the food. When serving the customer, giving clear and accurate instructions is important to avoid mistakes of giving out the wrong orders. When I have to packing the food items, keeping my partner informed of updates on customer orders and food stocks available is important to avoid delay in orders and bad customer service experience. Both of the roles require the responsibility to be well informed and reliable when working in teams. Being a reliable team member that delivers consistent quality performance is a way to build trust with the team member that the job can be accomplished from working together as a team. ","A time when I demonstrated leadership was during a work situation at KFC that occurred during the Boxing Day public holiday last year. it was a crazy busy day and queues were flooded with customers. The store manager had recently hired up to 10 new recruits and 4 of the new employees were assigned the same shift time as 3 other employees, including me on the day. At the start of the shift, I saw that the new employees were working among themselves and they were facing many difficulties with understanding the customers’ orders, operating the registers and preparation of the food. They were facing several customer complaints and the store queue was being held up with more customers. 

Being one of the older and more experienced employees, I decided to take charge of the situation. I decided to set up a buddy system where I allocated each new recruit to work with an experienced staff. I made sure the new recruits were assigned to tasks levels that they were more suited to and that they were more proficient in to keep the store operations going. Our team members’ friendly and supportive attitudes also helped the new recruits feel supported as they could openly asked questions to resolve their doubts and they were more engaged and motivated to work more productively. 

Besides this, my time management skills and strategic skills in work were also put to test on the day. I was proactive in ensuring that the food stocks were available at all times at the front of the stores by informing the food service team members to have the food cooked beforehand to avoid delays in delivering the customers’ order. I also took the initiative to assist the 2 staffs working at the burger station. I split the tasks so that each member can focus on one specific task to make the “Popular List” burgers, the “Special Orders” burger or the chicken wraps. These skills ensured that the store service was efficient and the quality of the food products were met.

Besides, I would also have chance to engage with mentors from industry and interview them about key graduate skills. Lastly, I could gain valuable advice on writing resume and cover letter, preparing for an interview and giving presentation. In conclusion, I think that taking part in this program will improve both my technical and interpersonal skills. It will be a good start point to my career pathway.

Firstly, I want to gain teamwork skills. When entering industry, teamwork skills are very essential because no one could complete a whole project by himself.  When doing a project, I need to liaise with my team members to ensure that everyone work towards to the same goal collaboratively instead of individually. Secondly, I want to gain time-management skills. Because in most situations, time is limited. For example, only five days are given to finish a team project in this program. So after breaking the whole project into many tasks, we should allocate each task suitable time to ensure the task would be successfully completed. How to make best use of limited time is really crucial. Lastly, I want to gain problem-solving skills.  These skills are important in my future career because there are always unpredictable issues coming up in workplace. Handling them in time would save money and effort for the company.","
I always maintain a good relationship with my team members when doing teamwork, and finish my tasks on time and in high quality. I would like to talk about working as a student consultant with my team members in Global Scope program held by UNSW in 2017. In this program, my team was assigned to provide business analysis report to better promote Sydney as an investment target for our client: NSW Trade & Investment. I worked collaboratively with my team members and provided them with my expertise on engineering. I also reviewed their work and gave them useful feedback. Besides, I stay in touch with them via Facebook in order to receive any instant message.  Furthermore, I had meetings with both team members and the client regularly to ensure everything is on track. My team members were satisfied with my work. At last, we delivered a good solution for the client, and we still in contact with others after this program.


","I would like to talk about a time when I successfully led a group of 18 to visit companies and interviewed industry leaders about key graduate skills in summer social practice. Before visiting companies, I asked my team members which employers they wanted to interview. Then I allocated each group member a company to contact and gave instructions about how to liaise with companies to ask for approval of visiting. Some of my team members failed at first. Instead of pushing them, I encouraged them and provided them with more details of the target company through the research I did. At the same time, I started to book hotel room for team members. I also held meetings every week to ensure that everything was on track. At last, 16 companies gave permission of visiting and agreed to hold information interview for us. During the visiting, I ensured that every team member was in good spirit and in good physical condition. After a day's visiting, I held a meeting at night to discuss what we had learned from industry leaders. It was a good way to reflect. Some of my team members did not like this kind of meeting. I had a talk with them and they complained that they were tired after finishing activities in the daytime. Considering this, I changed the frequency of meeting. Instead of everyday, we had meetings every four days. The summer social practice lasted for three weeks. I was very glad that everyone was happy. They were satisfied with my leadership and now we still contact each other. This experience let me understand that as a leader, I should hear others' thoughts and made arrangement in advance. I also need to think things thoroughly before making a decision. ",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jNlnXMf_FGaNLeRiqlVPYmAfLsC4Erfi/view?usp=sharing

I would also like to continue to develop my presentation and communication skills which I have made an active effort to improve with my involvement with UNSW Engsoc’s Engineering Industry Program (EIP). This experience has increased my confidence and I hope that through further involvement with extra-curricular activities I may continue to grow my confidence.,During group work I strive to be an active member that facilitates group communication. As a portfolio leader of Arc’s Stationery Reuse Program I guide and promote group discussion during meetings by encouraging all members to participate. It is important to acknowledge and value the input of all members as it creates a welcoming environment where members will contribute their ideas.,As a leader of a portfolio for Arc and a mentor for EIP I aim to be a positive role model for all the members of my team.

I have decided to apply because I thought that this was a unique program compared to many others because it is aimed solely at STEM students and to improve not just soft skills but also professional skills related to the stream. I have done plenty of programs at UNSW to improve soft skills and teamwork but none of those were aimed at engineering students nor were they related to my field of choice (computing and engineering). I am also applying because even as a third year I have not used my gained knowledge of my engineering stream outside of university and thought it was time to take the initiative to do so and to see what I can contribute with them in an actual intensive short-term project.,"I hope to gain communication and leadership skills, getting to know what it is like to work alongside other fellow engineering students of my stream e.g. how I would collaborate with others of the same field using my professional knowledge and skills on a short-term project. I would also like to gain some experience and exposure to what it is like to be working for the STEM/engineering workforce environment. Also to be able to call back to this experience, making it a valuable addition to my resume.","A time I performed well as part of a team was when I was volunteering for traffic control at a festival in my local area. We weren’t very acquainted with our job until we were briefed at the scene but as I was arriving I found that 3 of the 4 volunteers was already leaving the area telling me that it was fine to only seldom come back to the area to move the traffic cone every 30 minutes the bus would arrive. However despite this, me and one other volunteer did not leave, we stayed and did our job. we did this because we both knew that there was no certainty that the bus would arrive exactly on time and that there were other unexpected situations that might occur as well. It wasn’t until after the first 2 busses arrived that we had to accommodate for did the others arrive back in the scene and decide to stay and properly accomplish their assigned role with us. I think this was a good example of teamwork because two people in a team took initiative to cover for the others who were negligent but in the end knew their shortcomings and joined in.",A time I demonstrated leadership was during my time at the UNSW heroes program tasked with solving any problem related to the university. The first task was to identify and brainstorm until an idea was approved by the supervisor. For our first meeting with him every one of our ideas were put down. This was unexpected as we thought our team had many great ideas individually but we weren’t coherent with ourselves as a team and were just pushing our ideas for ourselves. I noticed this and discussed with the team about an idea that would cater to everyone’s idea of a problem at the university. This was labelled as my idea in the end but I believe that it was everyone’s ideas that lead to it and a successful pitch.,https://www.dropbox.com/s/3gy1p6zv5z2nebx/Henry-Phung.docx?dl=0

Applying for the STEM Leaders Program will give me the opportunity to develop these skills under professional guidance as well as allowing me to apply them in a realistic environment. I believe that partaking in the program will provide unique experiences which will be relevant to my career development.","I would like to use the STEM Leaders program as an opportunity to apply the skills which I have learnt in the classroom to solve real industry problems. It would be an excellent chance to increase my currently limited experiences with working in a professional workplace and greatly improve my networking and presentation skills. Developing and fostering these soft skills will greatly improve my interpersonal interactions and allow me to stand out from the crowd once I join the workforce. As well as this, I believe that completing this program will allow me to network and connect with peers who share my interests and passion, providing an essential stepping stone for future career development.","I was the captain of Baulkham Hills High School Junior and Intermediate chess teams. As team captain I was responsible for our team’s communication with the supervising teacher as well as management of transportation and scorekeeping when playing at other schools. I was able to create a positive team environment, and ensured that everyone was able to voice their opinions and problems that they were facing through proactively communicating with teammates. As a result, I was able to ensure that each member had an enjoyable experience, while maximising their contribution to the team. ","I was a finalist in UNSW’s Maker Games challenge in 2017, where students from STEM disciplines formed groups to pitch and prototype a solution for real world engineering problems given by various industry partners. In my team of 6, I acted as the project manager for the agile prototyping of our solution with Rebel Sports. As the project manager, I took responsibility of communication with the industry partners and ensured that each subdivision of the team was able to deliver their module of the prototype at each deadline. As well as this, I managed all of the meeting and event logistics required for the team and we were able to deliver a functional prototype solution at the showcase. Although we weren’t able to win the finals, I believe that my leadership of the group in terms of project management greatly improved the morale of the team and was the catalyst for our success.

I have understood the importance of soft skills in today’s industry and with the ever-growing competition, such abilities allow applicants to stand out and be successful. I believe that STEM leaders with its focus on upskilling and career-relevant education will therefore equip me with the necessary skills to navigate the modern workforce. Having previously participated in programs geared towards getting students ready for their careers, I have a faint idea on areas I should be developing myself in, however, these programs have not placed an emphasis on the STEM field. This program would give me a clear insight into what is expected of a STEM student in the workplace and the specialised project stream would be a great step for my own sector within STEM.","Particular things I am keen to learn from the STEM leaders program, are communication, tailoring your CV and cover letter towards the requirements of a position and nailing an interview. Currently, one of my shortcomings is confidence in communicating. I want to be able to have the confidence to voice my opinions in an office environment and in order to do so, I must solidify my understanding of the etiquette of interaction and socialisation in a professional workspace. In order to catch the hiring team’s attention, it is imperative to have a great CV/resume and a cover letter. I want to learn how to perfect this particular skill set. Furthermore I want to be able to appear relaxed, confident and knowledgeable in my job interview so as to increase my chances of successfully obtaining a position greatly.","During my time in the CSESOC socials team, many situations would require optimal teamwork skills in order to overcome situations with lots of pressure. An example of this was the welcome back BBQ, where the team was bombarded with a large amount of traffic. To avoid being bogged down, the team and I took initiative to do tasks rather than be told what to do as the event organisers could not oversee all tasks at all times. Throughout the event, the team would constantly communicate and delegate tasks within the group, mimicking an agile environment to ensure maximum productivity. If I had any trouble or needed a break, I would notify another member of the team rather than not voice the issue as doing so could potentially jeopardize efforts later. ","A time where I got the opportunity to exercise good leadership was during project work for the UNSW Heroes program. The entrepreneurial project was the crux of the program and certainly the central focus for our team, so it was imperative that group chemistry was present. During the last stages of the program, our team was lagging in terms of the work we had done towards the project and as a result, frequent arguments would occur due to the stressful environment. I recognised that the team needed a figure that could guide and facilitate collaborative efforts towards successfully meeting key deadlines and ensure that we were producing the best results possible. Therefore, I took initiative to organise meeting times where each member could voice their opinions face to face rather than online. This ensured that our group could work in a productive environment where they could engage with each other’s work and offer real-time feedback. I stressed the importance of constant communication and appropriate interaction as a solution to the pressure we were under as a group. I also took initiative to discuss progress with each different sub-team within the group to offer help and bridge different branches of the group together. It was also vital for me to listen to each member and use socialize with them in their own unique way. An example of this could be matching the energy levels of another individual so I could relay my point across effectively and understand them at the same time. Ultimately, through starting proper constant communication and forging team-bonds, I was able to employ my leadership skills effectively to make sure our end-result was finished and complete to the best of our ability.

Observing the differences in their interpersonal skills and leadership abilities was a huge motivation behind my application.
Apart from, my personal observation. I am curious to learn how individuals and groups communicate within the workplace environments. Including, small interactions between fellow colleagues to larger seminars/talks in front of a large audience. These are some of the skills that the program structure seems to teach or improve in individual’s that have taken part. I hope that by applying and joining the STEM Leader’s Program, I too will be able to improve and finetune my communication and teamwork skills. Vital skills for all aspects of life, social and within the STEM industry. 
","After going through and receiving feedback from a couple of interviews for both part-time jobs and internship applications, I have observed that my interview skills are lacking. Although, the various attempts have slowly improved these skills, I still believe that there is a lot more room for improvement. I believe the Leader’s Program would allow me to improve on these interview skills and help me gain the necessary knowledge to use the feedback given to my advantage. In turn, my communication skills for other aspects such as Cover Letters and Resumes will also be positively affected thus further aiding my career development. ","Being involved youth organisations over the past 5 years and university societies recently, I have been tasked to work with various teams. Each team had its unique dynamic and approach to tasks, which meant that I had to adapt to it. Having these adaptation skills was my strength because I could perform well as a team member, communicating with both responsive and unresponsive team members as well as handling delegated tasks with ease. One example of a time I worked well within a team was in 2nd year of University, where I was involved as a Youth Camp Leader. Within the team of leaders, we were tasked to create the different activities in the camp: workshops, physical games, etc. There were various ideas that was formulated, as a team member I could put forth my ideas as well as discuss and combine other ideas together to create some unique and interesting workshops. Listening and understanding other teammates ideas was the most important aspect in that team, which I practised and thus resulted in a good final team product. ","Last year I was given the opportunity to lead a camp team that was given the responsibility of creating and delivering all the workshops throughout the three-day children’s camp. These workshops ranged from small talks by various speakers to larger hands-on workshops, where team management was keen. Furthermore, the camp’s workshops were, for the first time, was to be solely run by youths and had an expectation to bring fresh and unique workshops to the camp. 
Having this high expectation and pressure for innovative ideas meant that I was required to effectively delegate and communicate between the team members to ensure their maximum efforts were placed. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of each team member was also a strong front in creating good team dynamic. The team meetings were held in a manner that ensured that team members could express and constructively input their ideas, which created a closer bond between team members. Due to this the team managed to set the bar higher than previous years of the camp run. It made a major impact on how the children reacted to these creative workshops, most of them being very involved in ways they have never been before. 
However, along with the impact it had on the participants of the camp, the team members and myself had an eye-opening experience. The experience taught me the skills required to effectively manage time, communicate with various people with different attitudes, to think out-of-the-box and to appreciate the final product of the team. It was a good introduction to the art of team interaction and communicating effectively, which I will be able to use in career development.

I've been playing soccer for 15 years and have been heavily involved with clubs on campus. This current soccer season we have lost every game 5-0 or worse (we've only had 5 games, but still, it's not good). During the last two games and at training I have really stepped up and performed in the midfield. I have complied with the coaches wishes when he has substituted me off or asked me to play in a foreign position, and took it upon myself to stayed calm, motivated, and keen to challenge myself. At half time I have always listened intently to what others have to say and build upon their points if necessary to motivate the team. On the field I always encourage teammates to do their best and habitually comment if anyone puts down another player or spreads negativity.","I am currently Secretary of Hellsoc UNSW (Hellenic Society of UNSW) and was President in 2017.

Specifically during the executive's organisation of Hellsoc's Ski Trip, we experienced a significant dispute that led to negative attitudes, deflated morales and a delay in organising the event. It was during this decline where I gathered the execs, took responsibility and accountability for the predicament we were in, and with a determined, positive approach, guided us back into the right direction and ensuring we reached our vision and deadline.

I understand that leadership is a behaviour. I try to observe how others lead everyday. By learning from great, charismatic speakers such as Martin Luther King Jr. (I know it's clique) to more introverted geniuses such as Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla. In more recent times I have been following the leadership of Kerwin Rae, a small business owner based in Sydney. I have attentively observed how he deals with difficult team members, immense deadline pressures and am grateful to watch and learn from him.

So far in university, I have primarily been focused on improving in my technical skills such as coding however, I recognise that soft skills can be just as important. Through the STEM Leaders Program, I hope to become a more well-rounded person by developing skills that are important but that I have not prioritised.

Furthermore, ever since entering university, I started to realise how much I did not know. While this was initially hard to take, it made me realise how excited I was to learn new things. The STEM Leader Program seems like a chance to learn beyond what courses at university can teach me and that excites me greatly.","One specific skill I hope to gain is personal branding. Throughout most of my life, I have been an introvert. While I still am, since coming to university, I have started to breakout of my shell. Personally, I feel that learning how to market myself would continue the process of becoming more confident. Furthermore, I am excited by the opportunity to improve in area that has room to grow. 

Another skill I hope to gain is networking. As a first year student, I have done minimal networking and am not completely sure how to start. Through this program, I hope to gain a strong understanding of networking that I can use to expand my network over the coming years at university. This would allow to take full advantage of events at university where I get the opportunity to talk to representatives from companies.","In general, I feel I participate well as part of a team. One example of this would be in high school where my group had to make a presentation about road safety. The presentation would be going on for one school day where people of different age groups would be coming in. We would need to explain to them the physics of road safety. My role in the team to was to make a slideshow presenting the information we found as well as explain one segment of what we had found. I felt I performed well as part of the team as I got my segments done and was willing to help my team members with their roles. For example, one team member was focusing on calculations. When he was having difficulty, I would try my best to help him find the solution.","One time I observed leadership that positively impact myself and others around was from the rover software team leader at BLUEsat. BLUEsat is UNSW’s student led space program. The role of the rover team is to work on developing and updating a rover to compete in International rover competitions, namely the European Rover competition. I joined the rover software team at the start of this year. During the 3rd week, there was a software team meeting where everyone explained the jobs they were doing. As someone who was new to the team and unfamiliar with the software and processes being used, this was daunting. At this point, I along with a couple of other new members had just completed some training.

During the meeting, after a person had explained what they were doing, the team leader would explain it again to the new members in a way that was easy to understand. This leadership had a positive impact in particular on the new members as it allowed us to better understand what was happening in the meeting. Furthermore, it made me feel like part of the team as he did not need to explain it but he went out of his way to ensure the new members understood what was happening.

In addition, after the meeting, the new members got their first tasks. The team leader clearly explained to us the different tasks available and what they entailed. As someone who was inexperienced, this was very helpful. This is because I had little knowledge of what would go into completing any of the tasks as well as the difficulty of each task.

Overall, I felt the team leader positively impacted the whole team and in particular the new members by taking the time to explain everything to us.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/16_CF1xrmq5QxGoAf0D0lGFg-O0kgawcjXb4MxJJ8tTE/edit?usp=sharing

This was evident in my engineering design project for MMAN2100 where I realised that one of my team members was struggling to complete his part on time and was very stressed from all the other assessments that were due for him. In response, I helped him complete his section by taking part of his work. This way, the task was completed on time, my team member was able to produce high quality work as he didn't need to rush and any possible conflicts were avoided. I believe that being understanding and willing to take initiative to help your team members out is very important for effective teamwork.","During one of the case competitions I did, my team leader had to leave for Korea during the middle of our case due to a family emergency. This meant that we would not be able to complete our task on time as we had planned. We were also fairly behind schedule at that point and the loss of our team leader caused moral to be pretty low. I recognised this problem and called for a team meeting to re-organise our respective parts and created a new schedule to follow to in order to finish on time. During the meeting I divided my team leader's part evenly amongst the remaining members. I also led discussions about additional things we needed to research and possible flaws to our solutions that we needed to fix. I set a deadline for when our slides needed to be completed and organised practice times so we could practice our presentation before the competition. During these practice times, I also had the initiative to bring in several friends that had extensive experience in presentations and case competitions to help critique our performance. Through these efforts we placed first in that round of the competition. I believed I showed extensive leadership abilities, especially in unexpected circumstances.

I ensure that every event gets marketed effectively, even during busy semester periods, and also help my team design posters and flyers. Besides that, I help the executive team in any way that I can, often assisting with UNSWMSA’s event logistics.","As described above, I hold an executive position in the UNSW Muslim Students Association as the Design team lead, but I also assist with the technology team a lot of the time. One of the most notable contributions I’ve made to the club is leading the adoption of new technology so that we can livestream our events and make them accessible to as wide of an audience as possible. This required consulting with the treasurer of the club to ensure we had sufficient funds to purchase the necessary equipment, and then directing my design team to create the graphics needed to produce an interesting and engaging livestream. 
After setting all of this up we were finally able to broadcast our first proper livestream during our last event (which you can check out on the UNSWMSA Facebook page). Although we did not have the equipment necessary to connect a proper camera, and had to resort to using a general webcam, the tech team were able to run the livestream without any issues. Seeing this first “trial run” go so smoothly was extremely rewarding, as was receiving the positive feedback from the community. Setting up the livestream opened up the event to a much wider audience, people who would otherwise not be able to come, and also allowed for more anonymous interaction for people who were too shy to ask questions publicly or in person.
Given that the guiding purpose of the UNSW Muslim Students Association is to spread the message of Islam and foster the Muslim community on campus, taking this step has made a huge impact on many people, bringing information and other people within closer reach of many.",https://goo.gl/YQpoY3

Id also like to gauge how well i can approach real projects to deliver viable solutions with my colleagues, and gain constructive critism on how well we do so i can improve myself early","I work very well in a team, it is a skill i continually develop as i play social spots weekly. A recent time i worked well with a team was at the EWB games. Despite not winning a game or scoring a single goal our team maintained a positive outlook the whole time and never felt the downside of being defeated. I was the only person who really knew how to play soccer, but in maintaining the spirit of the team and keeping everyone on an equal level i subbed off a lot and was goal-keeper rather than playing on the field.","Recently i was a camp leader at CEVSOC's first year camp, when someone in my group suffered a severe ankle injury. I was proactive ahead of actives, asking camp organisers what upcoming activities involved, and how someone unable to walk properly could participate. In developing strategies to keep my team member engaged, he was able to still use activities as ice breakers with fellow civil students, so as to forge new relationships and get the full camp experience.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9v0gi9k9cuzqoi/Jesse%20Bonanno%20Resume.docx?dl=0
4/27/2018 22:03:28,Oscar Liang,oscarliang17@hotmail.com,425037480,3,UNSW,Bachelor of Civil Engineering / Commerce,Civil Engineering,Facebook,"I have decided to apply due to the wide range of invaluable experience that the STEM Leaders Program can offer and benefit me. In the times I have spent studying at university, I have gained a lot regarding the technical aspects of being an engineer. However, in terms of developing myself as a character, specifically in the soft skills department, I have so much to learn. From resume writing to networking skills, I believe the STEM Leaders Program is perfect for developing my personal branding. The program also gives an opportunity to meet and collaborate members of the industry and other like-minded students which is something I am interested in doing. This is a big motivator for me to apply, as I would love an opportunity to showcase the skills to I have learnt thus far in my university experience and potentially gain insight into what it is really like to be in the workplace environment.","There are several specific skills I would love to gain and develop from completing this program. First one being effective communication skills. Whether it is written or verbal, I believe that this skill is the most important and will go a very long way in my career development as it is one of the translatable skill from job to job. One area I would love to gain in experience is the ability to express myself in an effective and confident manner. This can be in a form of a presentation or an interview and I believe that the STEM Leaders Program can assist me through its various workshops and the final pitch case. Another skill I would love to gain is leadership. Leadership is intertwined with other soft skills and I believe it is the most challenging skill to gain and develop and it’s sought after by many employees. As the program’s name suggests I believe the program can further hone my leadership skills.","I believe I perform exceptionally well as part of a team. This is due to the fact that I am honest and able to mediate discussions with the other team members. Being honest and transparent with your team members is in my own opinion one of the foundations of being a good team member since it gives the team a sense of trust with each other and ultimately make everyone work better. Mediating the discussions allows other members to understand my ideas and as well as gives an opportunity to give their own opinions, and consequently, makes the team more productive. An example of when I displayed these qualities was with EngSoc’s EIP. In EIP, everyone is assigned into their teams to work on a variety of case studies and pitch their solution to the case problem. When my team is stuck on how to tackle a new case study, I encouraged my team members to talk with each other about the case. This could be anything about the case, example what they didn’t understand about the context of problem. In this way, everyone can be on the same page and not on their individual. Engaging in the discussions enabled the team members who don’t usually speak up to be confident with themselves and this allows everyone to contribute their ideas to the solution, which again accelerates our team efforts and as result led us to a solution to a case in a timely fashion. These qualities I have displayed ensured that my team headed in the same direction together, which in the long run creates a friendly and healthy atmosphere which continued the rest of EIP.","In my team with St John Ambulance Cadet, I have observed many individuals that have demonstrated excellent leadership skills which have had a positive impact on me. One time, when I went on my first duty as a first aid officer in the Easter Show, I was paired up with an experienced officer. Since this was my first on duty, I had no prior experience in applying the skills I have learnt from training sessions and seminars to a practical scenario and this made very nervous as a result. Also, the fact that the Easter show is a popular destination in the Public Holidays didn’t help with my nervousness.  However, the person who I was paired with encouraged me and gave me his assurance that everything would be fine as long as I remembered the standard procedure for the common medical issues. It was not until after I performed my first supervised DRSABCD that my nerves went away. The experience was unique since you are responsible for taking care of the individual until they are treated adequately, and I have to give my partner credit. If it weren’t for my partner encouraging me to get out of my comfort zone in such a short time frame, I would have straight up asked him to do the all the work. My partner acted as a mentor and guided me throughout the whole process and not only made me consolidate the knowledge I have accumulated throughout the countless training sessions and apply it to a real scenario, he empowered me by giving me the confidence in performing the task. What I have learnt from my interaction with my partner from then, and it still has impact on me right now Is that it’s important that you shouldn’t feel comfortable for too long otherwise you will miss out on the opportunities to learn and grow as a person.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/ht73rrr1qa0xx8c/5.pdf?dl=0

As a new first year student I would love to experience the wide range of opportunities that are now available. Aiming to apply myself in all opportunities to grow and become a more versatile individual in terms of experience, leadership and skill. This highly commended opportunity would capitalise on such aims and push me in the right direction towards self improvement.  I also applied to such a program in order meet like minded individuals that understand the importance of developing such leadership skills and share a passion for the STEM field. This program, although intensive would be an amazing experience that I would be very grateful to be a part of. ","My perusal of the biomedical career stems from my love for both the development of growing technologies and the ability of medical applications in saving lives. However as fining employment in such a field is very difficult, especially in Australia, it is crucial to gain experience internships and optimise networking and presentation skills early on in order to maximise my employability. Thus from this program I hope  to work on my personal networking skills, gain crucial advice in securing internships and make myself more visible to future employers and colleagues.  I would also like to expand my social circle and improve on my confidence as a leader which will be crucial in putting forward ideas within the career. Taking initiative and has allowed to gain opportunities that, in the past, helped me to develop my experience in my career stream, therefore, I aim in continuing to maximise my ability to learn and strive towards being employed in my dream career. 
","I have been privileged to be a apart of many teams throughout my life. Including, sporting teams, music groups, volunteering groups and general employment teams. Throughout such experiences I have learnt the importance in understanding the needs of each individual and providing a safe space for everyone to share their ideas and thoughts without judgement. One experience that I have had in a team environment is being part of my local soccer team. I have enjoyed being a part of such a team everyone always tries their hardest in order to help each other in winning the game. This shows how enjoyable such experiences are when it is shared with people that although having a common goal in this aspect, take into account the feelings of others and put in everything for those around them. 
It is for this reason that I personally perform well in team environments and have played soccer for 12 years, as I enjoy gaining the opportunity to share such experiences with others.  ","Duke of Ed was a great experience that not only allowed me to gain independence and learn survival skills but also allowed me to develop and grow as a leader through the physical, skill and volunteering requirements needed to gain my Bronze award. Being able to independently climb the ‘Blue Mountains’ in groups of 5 students with the use of maps and compasses, tested leadership and problem-solving skills from choosing a route to crossing a river that could potentially be too deep to cross. This allowed us to exercise the values of leadership through perseverance and determination to finish the trek and find our own ways to an assigned end-point. This required students to step up and take control of conflicting opinions and make a decision that would produce the best results. As a leader, I assigned individual roles for each student depending on their abilities exhibited through the course of the hike. I assigned one person to control the compass to update our direction, one person on the map to ensure we are heading in a safe direction, one person to look out for formations to confirm we were heading in the right direction and one person to monitor the satellite device in case of an emergency. This ultimately improved my confidence, minimised conflict and lead to a smoother hiking experience. However, on this hike as the team began to become tired, frustrations caused tensions between members to arise. In order to reduce such tension, I introduced a team activity and offered to carry extra load in order to distract members and help them from being too tired to continue hiking. This proved very effective and taught the importance of creativity as a leader as well as serving and placing the needs of others before your own.

I think that the program can give me a wealth of knowledge proportional to the length of the session, and skills that I will be able to apply in my life in the future. I also feel that the collaboration alongside firms will be an invaluable experience where I will not only learn more about how I approach things but I will also be able to interact with and be inspired by the like-indeed peers that want to develop themselves professionally and the mentors who are willing to impart knowledge about STEM in professional industries. I also had a friend do the program last year who recommended it for professional skills development.","I want to gain an understanding of the professional world that I am studying to be in - how what I learn in university becomes implemented professionally and the processes of how problems are solved in a engineering business context. Moreover, I want to learn how to present myself to employers: in written form it would be resume writing and LinkedIn, but the I want to begin to develop my networking skills and how I present myself can contribute to personal branding. For university students, networking is an alien thing in which we do not know where to start. For me, I want to be able to successfully network and I think that the program will help in this regard both my personal skills and career development.","I think I perform satisfactorily in a team. At my job at Woolworths, it is our department's function to stock the shelves while helping customers. Although not all the members of the department work together, it is necessary that we complete the quota for each shift. I think what I bring to a team is the ability to lift morale through my lightheartedness and jokes but to also influence others in a team with my initiative to find the motivation themselves to get their job done. Every week during my shifts it is necessary that the team ensures that it keeps its morale high. However, when the situation requires, I take initiative to help customers by taking an extra step, such as fixing displays with items on sale.","My entire experience as a leader in cadets was a challenge in a team setting because it involved undertaking the new position of a section commander, and with it the roles and responsibilities. Having led a group of year 9 boys, I encountered problems such as disobedience and organisation within the team. This forced me to gain respect of my subordinates and to be able to structurally set out goals to achieve given team objectives. This former was achieved throughout the year by initial strong and strict discipline, where I was disallowed to bond to the cadets as a peer, but rather to lead from above and keeping distance. This was specifically a challenge for me as there is only a two-year age gap between me and the subordinates, and I am quite a social person. However, I was able to divorce friends from subordinates to achieve maximum efficiency within the team. In regards to achieving team objectives, I learnt to delegate tasks in differing situations (such as bushcraft or theoretical first aid) so that the team could carry out a main objective through each task. Thus, this taught me the necessity of concurrent activity and efficient leadership.

I think this experience positively impacted me because I was able to develop myself as a leader. Furthermore, the boys that were under my care did not only learn about how to go about situations in the bush, but I think I developed morale so that the learning experience was enjoyable.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0PKV72gVJ-dv95Rr2IFifgNO4GflRbp/view?usp=sharing

In addition, I want to improve various technical and soft skills to further develop myself through the workshops provided. I also see this program as an opportunity to impress industry professionals and expand my growing network. I’m a firm believer that with experience I take, I can continue to grow interpersonally and professionally. Finally, I hope to meet some new people in this program and have fun working together to solve a problem.","Ever since my first experience in public speaking, I’ve always noticed there were areas I needed to work on. Therefore, I want to further develop my public speaking and presentation skills. I hope I can utilise the advice from industry professionals and workshops as much as possible. In conjunction, I believe a chance to pitch in front of a large audience would be a great opportunity to help me boost my confidence and put forward a compelling argument. 

Previously, I’ve been rejected and I think there’s a need for improvement in my resume writing skills. With this program, I want to learn how to write a good resume and cover letter that stands out to potential employers. Subsequently, I hope with feedback from the mock interviews, I can become a more well-rounded individual.","One example of when I worked effectively in a team was during a local community volunteering event in the winter holidays last year where I helped run a children’s art workshop. I was initially in charge of making sandwiches and helping out with catering but due to shortage of people on the day, I offered to help out with running the pottery lessons. Another girl and I were in charge of cutting and distributing bits of clay to the children. 

It seemed pretty straightforward but while we were distributing the clay, the children were getting restless and started arguing so I suggested to the girl working with me to play a game of heads down thumbs up with the children to keep them busy while I cut and distributed the clay. This worked out really well.

Even though we had many tasks that weren't familiar to us, we worked cohesively as a team by delegating roles in order to maximise efficiency. This experience helped me reaffirm the value of teamwork and the notion that many hands make light work. ","During an ENGG1000 project, my team had to build a bionic arm. During construction, our arm kept failing to work and after three unsuccessful attempts, everyone became unmotivated with more than half the group failing to show up to group meetings. At the end, I decided to step up to the leadership position and after asking for advice from the course coordinator, I made everyone attend a Create workshop with me where we asked students that had experience in arduinos help us with our project. At the end, our bionic arm was successfully working.

What I learnt from this experience was that although chances of success may seem very bleak, a positive mindset and not giving up is a fundamental key to success. I put a smile on my face even though I was somewhat doubtful about the outcome because I realised that when a leader has a negative mindset, it affects the motivation of the whole team. I encouraged the rest of my team members to adopt a positive mindset by typing up a motivational paragraph on the group conversation. ",

I think this program provides an invaluable opportunity to experience hands on engineering in this field, develop ideas and concepts to address current issues in the industry. These skills are essential for my future career and this program will highly assist me to further develop myself. I believe the STEM Leaders Program will also provide an excellent platform to nurture my professional development.","By completing this program, I hope to develop both my soft skills and technical skills through the numerous workshops in this program. Such soft skills include resume writing, assessment centre skills and networking skills. I believe the project encased in this program will also allow me to reflect and improve on my professional speaking and presenting skills that carry into the workplace. I would also like to form meaningful relationships with mentors to gain valuable career advice. These opportunities are rare to come by and will be a leading step to my career development. The opportunity to network with leading organisations would provide a greater understanding of the industry, and insights on potential growths and opportunities. ","I believe I work well and thrive in team environments where people of different perspectives come together to develop an end goal can bring a feeling of satisfaction and success.
One of the events I assisted in organising was an event run by Vision Generation. The goal of the event was to individually pack 400 birthing kits which were to be sent to developing countries around the world to increase sanitisation practices. Due to the lack of Vision Generation members available on the day, I took initiative and decided to help and take place of a member who was unable to make it there on the day. I was given the majority of the information on the day and assisted in setting up the five stations required to maximise effective packing of the kits. 

The lack of communication between the organisation team and the volunteers prior to the event resulted in some confusion however this was resolved quickly via effective communication between everyone and discussing as a group together before splitting into our dedicated roles. Due to good communication and teamwork within the team, we were able to alter the original plan in order to maximise efficiency. This event highlighted the importance of communication within the team, coordinating the roles of each person and working within a time constraint.","In the first year of university, I completed a civil group project in ENGG1000 which consisted of 6 members. With little knowledge at the time, communication between the team developed and progressed very slowly due to the little introduction and communication between the group members prior to the assignment. However, one of our members, Richard, was a 3rd year student and his leadership maximised the potential of our team via consistent communication, ensuring all opinions are heard and maintained a proactive learning environment. Through consistent communication, our team bonded closely leading to regular meet ups and group activities outside of university. Team contributions were significantly important during the initial design development of our project and our teamwork continuously grew throughout the project duration. Our team member felt comfortable to contribute ideas, and pause if there were any misunderstandings or further explanation if needed. Furthermore, his leadership skills brought the group together and we were able to work coherently which ultimately led to a successful project with a sense of unity within the group.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/zoicnbnyi8mhop6/Resume.docx?dl=0

It was confronting at first to be teaching my peers a skill I had just recently learnt but once I started the workshop everything seemed to fall into place. It was then I realised how the idea of something can appear much bigger than it is and that the only solution to nerves and not feeling strong enough for a role is to do. I learnt then that my preparation for the workshop and my hours of practice were what got me through to be a leader. The issue was just crossing that initial barrier of doubt that unlocks you to amazing opportunities. A lot of the times, a leader can be confused with a mean boss but it was then I realised a leader is someone who guides and respects other people and other opinions.

I also believe that in order to be a leader in the STEM industry, these skills are a must and I believe that the Real Skills Education STEM Leaders Program is the first step in order to become a leader of the future.

I also applied to the STEM Leaders Program because of multiple recommendations from people that had done the program. Simply through observation, I noticed that all of these people had something in common, they were all able to communicate and network so easily, something that I will always be interested in working towards!

It is these reasons, that I’m keen to get involved and participate in the 2018 winter program.","By completing the STEM Leaders Program, I hope to gain and develop my speaking skills and my ability to communicate a message clearly to a group of people whether it be in a presentation, or in a general setting.

Further, I wish to improve my resume and the way I brand myself to others by hopefully determining my major strengths and weaknesses in stem-based settings. 

I also wish to develop my collaborative skills and my ability to work as part of a team in a way that will provide maximal positive impact to the team’s objective.

It is these skills that I believe will greatly aid my career development and allow me to succeed in my future endeavours in a STEM career.
","I believe I work quite well in a team, but there is always room for improvement. A time where I worked well in a team would be during my time as Marketing Manager for CEVSOC. During this role, I was in charge of organising all promotions for the society. I believe I worked well in this team because I consistently communicated with relevant subcommittee managers to develop appropriate marketing plans to maximise attendance at events.

I also used feedback to streamline processes, for example the information used in promotion requests was generally never the final information. I implemented the use of google docs so dynamic real time change could occur therefore eliminating previous issues of having out of date descriptions and posts on our social media streams.

It is through my constant collaboration and communication with other subcommittee teams that I have been able to benefit the society as a whole and is therefore why I believe I worked quite well in this team.

","During my time as School Captain, I proposed the development of a year 9 peer mentoring program, the first of its kind at our school. The aim of the program was to essentially mentor these students at a critical point in their high school lives where what they did could dramatically affect the rest of their high school lives.

Working as a member of the leadership team, I drove the development of this program through hosting multiple meetings with the team and executive staff in order to create a plan of action. 

Our team found out that a lot of the students actually didn’t know many people outside of their small friend groups and that a lot of them tended to be fairly antisocial when it came to meeting new people. Our team decided to implement a plan whereby we sat down with a group of 4-5 students and drove conversation between the students to create a connection.

The results were fantastic! We noticed a greater amount of mixture between the students with many of them feeling far more comfortable meeting new people.

I am proud to say the success of each day was largely dependent on my leadership abilities and clear oral communication skills. For instance, I prioritised and delegated tasks efficiently to each team member, which allowed the team to stay organised and focused throughout the day.

For instance, when I volunteered as a support officer at the Ronald McDonalds House Randwick (from March 2017 to July 2017) I was typically in charge of providing emotional support for families going through hardship. On a typical day I proactively greeted families and offered any assistance, wherever possible, to ensure a comfortable and home-like experience. In addition, I attentively listen to families of ill children and provided emotional support wherever possible. However, there were some occasions where the house in which the families lived were in a terrible state due to the housekeeper not being there. Therefore, I decided to enlist another volunteer who was present at the time to help me improve the overall hygiene of the house. Through my leadership we were able to ensure the living quarters of the house was impeccable. This definitely impacted others, but I am proud to say it predominantly impacted the families living in the household during that time.

As in my engineering degree, it has become increasingly difficult and competitive to find a job straight after university.

I have learnt that leadership is a crucial part to be successful in the whatever field you are in, because to succeed at the job or project that is at hand, a strong leader is needed to lead the team onto a clear path. 
Throughout my time at university I have participated in many team events throughout campus, to try expose myself to the outside world.  For example, I volunteered through many of Food for All association’s events, they are a non-profit organisation that raises fund through events on campus to donate to their chosen charity.","Last semester, I helped run their bbq event which was in collaboration with EngSoc's vdp members, so I had to run the logistics and organise the team members with the help of the president of Food for All. I had to delgeate roles for each member and ensure that everyone was accounted for, so that the event would run smoothly. On that day we had a team of six members including me, I put two people operating the bbq, sent two people to help promote our societies and one member and myself to manage the line and assist with sign up sheets. I would consider the day as successful as we all had fun and even made a profit in donations.","During my time at McDonalds, I had many times that the managers left the back area for me to look after, while they had to do admin work. As a crew trainer, I had to delegate jobs to the crew members so that we could get over the lunch time. Since I was crew trainer and the most experience in the back area, the manger left me in charge and I had to make sure we had enough stock and telling people to get product down. 
I have also observed leadership through Elon musk, a man of many talents. I have looked up to him at a young age, and was inspired by him to pursue an STEMs degree. I believe in his vision of making life multiplanetary by expanding to Mars. Through him, I want to eventually make an impact to people the way he revolutionises technology.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rAYYra-FWj09ccERuH0_EeXiQKylN_6H/view?usp=sharing

I have found that working on real-world scenarios is a situation where I am able to learn a wider range of soft skills, such as communication and collaboration, and gain a deeper understanding of the material I learn in my engineering degree. However, opportunities to work on these projects are rare as a student in the civil engineering area, and so I am excited that the STEM Leaders Program has partnered with engineering companies so that these projects are available. Furthermore, the opportunity to engage with industry mentors, and participate in workshops to improve my performance in the recruitment process of these companies also drew me to the program.","Through this program, I want to learn the skills to tackle a real civil engineering problem as part of a team. This includes developing a wide range of problem-solving strategies to generate innovative potential solutions, the ability to communicate ideas to my colleagues, giving and receiving feedback in a constructive manner, evaluating and selecting designs in a systematic fashion and presenting solutions to clients. Additionally, in completing this program, I want to learn how to effectively network at careers fairs and other networking events to engage and build lasting relationships with other people attending, perform well in interviews and assessment centres, and other aspects of the recruitment process.","I have worked as a developer in the data acquisition department of UNSW Redback Racing from my first year at UNSW until present. I believe the support of my teammates, who answered my questions about every aspect of our system was essential in me becoming a productive member of the team. As I gained experience, I was able to contribute to several design decisions, such as the decision to implement a user login system to enable members of the team to personalise the setup of our data visualisation software easily. Being involved in design decisions like this increased my sense of ownership of the product due to the input I had, and consequently led to my motivation to take an increased role in the team.","I participated in the Engineers Without Borders Appropriate Technology competition in 2017, where my team of six was tasked with creating a design to improve water supply and sanitation in mountainous regions of Nepal. During the design process, we generated several ideas on how to collect and store a significant amount of water to last the dry season, and how to treat and re-use wastewater in a productive manner. However, I was concerned about how our team would evaluate these designs in a systematic and consistent manner to select the best solution to build. Firstly, it was difficult to judge a design for improving water supply with one that improved sanitation, since they had two different purposes. Furthermore, in order to complete the evaluation in a reasonable amount of time, each team member needed to evaluate a subset of the designs by themselves, which introduced issues with consistency of judging. To resolve these issues, I took the initiative to create a set of judging criteria, for which designs could be evaluated against. I selected criteria based on the aspects of appropriate technology, including sustainability, local availability of materials and skills, and cost efficiency. These aspects were applicable to both water collection and sanitation devices. Additionally, I quantified points as much as possible, such as the percentage of daily water consumption the system would process, which ensured that the score that each design received would be consistent regardless of the team member who judged it. Through this new judging criteria, my team was able to produce a decision matrix to select the most appropriate designs to prototype, and justify our design decisions during the final judging process.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vHHSp56gZ57ZunIrdY5cK1gzlqAnM3-y

In short they seem to be growing into the STEM leaders of the future as a result of SLP, which has inspired me to apply for the program.
I’m committed to taking action towards the development of my career and personality and refuse to rest on my laurels as I’ve inspired by the forward movement of my peers in their careers and I know that the SLP program will provide me with the necessary Professional Development Skills.
","
The specific skills I’m looking to develop right now are my LinkedIn/Personal Branding and Networking Skills. Unfortunately, conventional education/degrees don’t offer development of any these skills but thankfully programs like SLP help STEM students to obtain the right tools that are essential for their career development.
","	Just recently my Customer Service Manager, at my part time work in Coles, had lost her father and had to unexpectedly leave the country to attend his funeral. As one of the senior members of the team it was important for me to step-up in my role and over the past couple of weeks our peak periods have run smoothly thanks to the solid communication between the senior members of the team and the guidance we as seniors provide to the less experienced members.
As we lost an integral team member it was important to have a more versatile team  so that service could run as smooth as possible and as such I was tasked with coaching some of the newer members on how to operate and run the self-checkout area allowing which allowed better functioning of the team.
","
Last year one of the members of our Design Team had a certain work ethic and approach to uni life that really inspired everyone else in our team to do our best and allow us to become one of the higher performing teams of our 2130 cohort.
What made him so inspiring to us is that this particular individual had a plethora of extra-curricular activities that he was a part of ranging from Winter Uni Games to being apart of the Uni’s International Robotics Soccer team and despite all of that he managed to do well in all his subjects. He was the natural leader for the group, dictating meeting times, organising group-calls and actively messaging in our group chats, his drive to perform at a high standard had a knock-on effect on all the other members and also forced us to bring up our game.
I came to the realisation that when you have individuals like him who have an overall drive and vision for themselves, it’s an infectious trait that spreads on to those you work with and motivates them to work to their best of their ability. It’s this characteristic, among others, which I believe are axiomatic traits of a Leader and I wish to obtain.

I wanted to break out of my comfort zone and meet others who were like minded and within the STEM field. I believe this program will benefit all participants as it allows the individual to be more interactive with their peers and the leaders around them which can build on their communication and social skills.,The main skill I would like to gain would be public speaking as I am most nervous when I have to speak in front of people. I would like to be more outspoken as an individual and voice my opinion out more. I also want to enhance on leadership and teamwork skills which will be useful throughout life whether it be at university or at work as a waitress. These will help within career development areas as it will allow the person to be more confident when speaking in front of their peers or strangers.,"I am more of a listener within a group but I also complete my tasks on time to ensure that the overall project can be done efficiently. By being a listener, I can engage with others thoughts which can build on my own whilst also lessening arguments within the group. However at work, I am more of a leader as I have the most work experience so I have to tell others what to do to ensure that everyone knows their job and can complete it effectively. Both work effectively within each environment as it allows more cooperation with the peers involved.","With work as a waitress, I am the leader of the waiters due to my longer work experience. This means I must tell other waiters what to do so every customer is attended to and is satisfied with the service provided. When small disputes or complaints arise, I will try to solve them as soon as possible. I also have to think quickly on my feet for other waiters who may have problems that need to be solved. Complaints such as wrong food or food taking too long to cook may arise and in times like these, I relay it back to the kitchen to ensure that they know of how to rectify this error by creating another dish or working quicker. Other waiters also ask me to do other complicated stuff so I assign easier jobs to them and harder ones to myself so everyone can work at their quickest pace. This has positively impacted on the restaurant and others around me as it creates a good environment for customers to feel relaxed and attended to. It has made a great impact on me as it allows me to speak up more and build on my leadership and teamwork skills to lead the team better.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/alison-chan-b38774114/

Within this program, I will get the opportunity to work on real life project. I believe this will be beneficial to myself in learning more technical skills in order to achieve success while applying my skills and knowledge I have learnt throughout the university.  Also, the professional development workshop will also enable myself to further develop and improve my soft skills such as communication skill, teamwork skill and leadership skill, making myself to be more competitive and more capable when applying for a full time job. This can also be helpful for myself to grow and develop as a person. Finally, I can also meet talented and passionate mentors, enabling myself to expand my network and make more meaning connections.  
","Throughout this program, what I would like to gain most is the analytical skill and the leadership skill. 
After completing the program in the Math/Stats/Data Science stream, I would love to get this opportunity to experience real life projects and become a critical thinker with an analytical mind when solving complex problems. As a final year student studying Bachelor of Actuarial Studies and commerce, having analytical skill will be highly valuable for my future career development when developing a career as an actuarial analyst. 
In addition, development strong leadership skill will aid my career development in various ways. Showing ability to lead a group is a very powerful skill while demonstrating initiatives and innovations I would love to learn and further develop my leadership skill while working as part of the team with other talented people because it is valued almost everywhere in future workplaces. 

","As a project officer at the Transition Team at the UNSW Skills Development Program, I believe that I am an effective team member because I not only complete all the work for the team at a high standard, but I also create team member satisfaction and ensure smooth team functions at all time. In the team meeting, as a member of the team, I continuously contribute my unique, original ideas to the team those will make the O-Week information session more fun and engaging for new students using my innovative thinking skill.  Apart from this, I am also a good listener, as I show respect towards others’ opinion and keep the level of team conflict to a minimum. I apply my effective communication skill when negotiating on details of the work, and demonstrate passion and a positive attitude at all time, especially when my team have difficulties in solving problems.  ","At Epping YMCA Table Tennis Club, I was a team captain for two years. During one of the competition matches, my team was losing by 0-3, with my teammates losing their calmness and confidence. They started showing signs of concerns, and lack of passion was observed. 
To overturn this negative situation, I suddenly realise that I must make some necessary changes. I hid my dissatisfaction and frustration, and took minimal time to collect my thoughts and analyse the situation through careful and critical thinking. I immediately held a short meeting during a break. During this meeting, I communicated with my teammates calmly but convincingly about my main objectives. I criticised some of my teammates’ mistakes respectfully, and then convincingly informed them about how to get the fundamental things correct. I explained to them about the weaknesses of the opponent, and designed strategies about how we can use our key strengths to beat the opponent. I also reminded my teammates about how competitive and dominant we were when playing against much tougher opponents in previous matches. 
My teammates immediately felt much more confident and energetic again. We started demonstrating all of our skills and core strengths, as well as playing with a positive and confident mindset. I continuously motivated them whenever they felt they have some pressure on the score board. 
Finally, my team regained the momentum by winning five games in a row. I have not only led the team to win by 5-4, but I also made my teammates to regain self-confidence and self-belief. This was a great opportunity for my teammates to realise how much potential they actually have, and teach them a great lesson on how any seemingly impossible goals are actually possible to achieve through dedication, passion and hard work.

I think due to the heavy technical focus of an Engineering degree a lot of students lose sight of the importance of the softer skills.  Skills such as communication, public speaking, leadership and many more.  I’m sure this has been said before, but all the genius in the world won’t help you if you can’t communicate your ideas with others.  If you can’t persuade others to believe in or invest in your project, or if you can’t work with others to achieve that vision.  This program would be an invaluable opportunity to practice these skills in an engineering-focused context, and give me a leading edge over others in my cohort that would assist me in pursuing my desired career.","From what I have seen in promotional material, the program boasts a wide array of workshops and activities designed to prepare students for the professional workplace, and to help them get there in the first place.  With the time for internship applications approaching fast, the opportunity to participate in an assessment centre workshop would be invaluable.  I would love to develop my interview skills, particularly in terms of being able to sell myself to an interviewer.  I’m also very excited at the prospect of the pitch night.  Although I have had some experience with public speaking, it has never been at this level or in this context.  Presenting to a panel of industry professionals on a subject related to my studies would be an incredible way to develop my confidence and professionalism. ","A year ago I was part of the Yellow Shirts Development program, and O-Week could get pretty tough with the whole squad volunteering long hours every day on little sleep.  In these environments,  tensions can run high and teams can break down.  I tried to prevent conflict by keeping open and honest communication between the group.  This meant communication in terms of how team members were feeling and who wasn’t pulling their weight.  I also found it was important to have empathy for your team members and provide a support network for those who are struggling.  Morale was also a big thing, and I learnt not to underestimate the importance of camaraderie and plain old fun in lifting spirits and therefore lifting performance. ","Over the last three years I have been heavily involved with a society called Law Revue, which puts on a comedy sketch show every year. Despite having no previous experience in theatre, acting, or anything else of the sort, and despite not having any relation to Law, the society ended up almost single handedly shaping my uni experience.  I never envisioned myself capable of standing on a stage acting, singing and dancing, but it is for that very reason that I fell in love with the society and became one of its Vice-Presidents and Directors in my third year. It takes people who have no prior experience, and it gives them a community and an atmosphere in which they can grow and thrive.  And I don’t necessarily mean grow into a talented performer.  As a show’s director, sometimes it is tempting to wish for a cast of brilliant actors and talented singers.  But I have come to learn that the most satisfaction comes from the people who are hesitant and uncertain and don’t necessarily believe they can do something like this; the satisfaction comes from helping them outgrow their fears and their insecurities.  It happened to me in my first year, and I wanted to be able to help others go through that experience and that personal development as well.  As a leader, I believe that creating a welcoming, supportive and enriching environment for the people around you is crucial.  Those who feel they are part of a community are infinitely more likely to give up time and effort to see that community thrive, whether that community is a theatre group or an engineering pitch team.

These skills are very much valued in the industry. Therefore, I would like to enhance these professional skills. These professional developments are important in order to maximise the experience and fully unleash your potential, whether it be workplace or normal day to day task. Moreover, it also provides opportunity to interact with like-minded people in the STEM industry and get better understanding of the industry. ","While there many skills to be achieved by this program, the one I am most interested in developing is leadership skills. Because I understand the importance of good leadership, I admire great leaders and aspire to be like them. However, I sometimes lack the eagerness to take up the role of a leader.  Therefore, I would like to develop the confidence to lead in situations and be an effective leader. ","Team work plays a vital role in the achievement of any project. I am always looking forward to working in teams because of the various ideas generated, and the uniqueness of individuals which always provides a fresh perspective. I have had the opportunity to work in groups many times, being involved in projects and dancing. One of the recent team project I was involved in was Arduino Project by Thales. The time period for project was quite short and it was admist the exam period, hence, managing time was a challenge. Yet the passion for the project and determination of the other team members, motivated me to find time and to do well in the project. Therefore, I understood the importance of each member contributing because everyone has same workload. ","I had been part of the organising committee for a cultural event. The task required arranging the performances and informing the participants about the details of the event. I was also responsible for the performances of the younger participants, which was a bit challenging, because it was hard to articulate to them. Therefore, I needed a method which would be easy for them to adopt, hence clear communication and repetition/reminders were crucial. Some performers were reluctant and required motivation. So, to motivate them I made them realise the value of performing and expressing, and how they and others, will be proud of them. By providing them an incentive they overcame their fear. Moreover, during the event small hindrances and confusions are inevitable. However, in order to not let it become a huge issue, our team had a strong communication protocol. Everyone was advised to remain calm and solve the issue as soon as possible. Following very simple rules of effective team work and leadership, can make any event/project success.
According to me, the most important role of a leader is to inspire and motivate others. And this is achieved by being empathetic. When I have worked with other leaders, I have observed their empathy and open-minded attitude is very admirable. On top of that, having a clear vision and objective, and the communicating that vision to other is also critical.  ",https://www.dropbox.com/s/xw1bltqizjavgum/Curriculum%20Vitae3.pdf?dl=0

In the last 4 months, I’ve started applying for roles and programs, aimed specifically to develop communication and interpersonal skills. Communication has always been a struggle for me and through leadership programs like these, I’m learning the necessary skills to communicate with other people and employers. As a passionate STEM student, I’ve always been a large supporter of STEM education. I feel this is the perfect opportunity to continue developing my interpersonal skills and to show that I can inspire current and future students to embrace STEM.","I would like to develop my networking skills, as I would like to have the ability to communicate with potential employers more effectively. I would also like to start developing my personal brand. I’ve noticed that there is an emphasis on developing your personal brand both in person and online as a part of professional development. I would like to start or continue developing my personal brand as I believe it could aid me towards a future STEM career.","I work well in a team. In my hospitality job, I work in a team with others in order to meet the demands in a fast pace and high stress environment. These demands can be as simple as  cleaning your work area to getting food and drinks out to the customers in a timely fashion. I also have worked in teams for a number of projects throughout my university degree and during the internship that I’ve currently undergoing. In these situations, I  constantly liaise with other team members in order to meet goals.
I work well in these team environments as I have the ability to adapt in difficult situations in a changing environment. I also have the ability to share ideas with others, which is crucial to innovation and problem solving and I also listen and help others to achieve common team goals. 
","Recently, I’ve joined a high school ‘FIRST Robotics Competition’ team as a mentor. In my mentoring role, I’m responsible for leading a team of students to produce the marketing and media material. During competition season, I also help guide students in problem solving when building their robot for the challenges that the competition requires them to do.
Embracing a mentoring and leadership role allows me to share my experiences with younger students. It is through these experiences where the most learning happens. Having this leadership role not only allows me to act as a role model for high school students, it is also a way for myself to  continue develop new skills. Although I don’t have any background in mechatronics/robotics and marketing/media, I’m learning beyond my expertise which allows me to expand my knowledge, making me a well-rounded person. My current background in Chemistry, Mathematics, Science and Engineering and my past work/academic experiences in these fields offers valuable insights to students, which allows me to pass down my knowledge and skill set to them. To know that a student can learn skills from you is the most rewarding experience that I can have as a leader.

Also, it would be a great opportunity to interact with industry mentors to learn from their experiences as well as have a greater insight to what it is like working within the industry, analysing relevant projects.","I would particularly like to improve my presentation and networking skills as it would really boost my confidence when speaking to and communicating with others, especially in more career-focused environments. This is such a crucial part in opening so many avenues and new opportunities when making an impression and presenting yourself well which I would like to practise and work on. 

Also, refining my critical analytic skills in coming up with possible solutions to relevant projects in the STEM industry will also be very important in any task in the workforce, or even in everyday life. The STEM Leaders Program gives a well-rounded, comprehensive experience in furthering a multitude of skills that are key for your career development which I would love to partake in.","In a team, I tend to observe my other teammates and see what roles they tend to assume, and then try be flexible and complement the group. If the other members of the team are quite outspoken, I am able to take a step back and be more of an active listener, whereas if my teammates are quite shy to speak up, I assume a more leadership role, asking for their opinions and ideas.

Once, I was randomly placed in a group and had to make a video with my team. During our brainstorming session, I realised that one of my teammates was quite shy and hesitated to speak as the others were more outspoken, so I asked about her ideas directly and encouraged her with some praise and feedback.","Observing the Directors of UNSW CSE Revue at the AGM, being bombarded with accusatory questions, I was very impressed with how they handled themselves and responded to the questions in front of the large audience. Lack of communication with one particular team was the issue, however, I did not think the way it was brought up was done very well. The Directors remained calm and really thought about the issue and responded in a calm, logical way. They also took responsibility and admitted that they were wrong in going about their role in this case and discussed some improvements for next time as well as making sure that they would make a formal apology to the team involved.

I really admired that they were able to accept that they were incorrect in the way they interacted with the team and were going to apologise to them properly instead of just sweeping the issues under the rug. It showed me that a leader does not only take credit for the success of their efforts, but also has to be responsible for their actions if problems arise and must truly try and make a difference to repair things.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SToRLYqgRrgq9HBfOVucSGFgim9oZ8OkOoF2d2X8kTw/edit?usp=sharing

- public speaking
- team leadership
- communication abilties","I perform exceptionally well working in a team. 

I currently volunteer as an Event Horizon Team Member through UNSW Arc. Our team member was not present for one of the events leading for our members to feel quite lost. I was given a debrief of the team leaders role within the team. I took the initiative to delegate everyone roles to ensure the smooth succession of our event.

- weekly meetings with studnets to track their progress
- providing feedback/reports every fortnight
- providing the studnets with the autonomy to express their ideas
- equipping studnets with the resources needed to pursue their project

4/27/2018 23:49:47,Hayden Ou,haydenou98@gmail.com,479171639,2,UNSW,Chemical Engineering,Chemical Engineering,Friend,I think the STEM Leaders program is a great way to develop and access skills that aren't taught in the classroom environment. The ability to work in collaborative efforts with leaders in the STEM industry that have proven background experience is a great opportunity that I would love to be a part of. I think that the program will be impactful in assisting in my transition into a corporate environment where soft skills and professionalism are key fundamentals.,"As a motivated individual, I am always looking to improve myself. Despite the extensive amount of technical knowledge passed through lecturers, I think I specifically wish to develop well-rounded technical skills that can be relevant no matter the career path (e.g. python, data analysis, autocad, powerpoint etc). In addition, I wish to develop my communication and presenting abilities; I wish to improve my clarity and get my intended meaning across more reliably and consistently. ","For our first year subject, we had to design a battery powered vehicle as part of our engineering elective. In our discussion, I felt like there was a distinct sense of progress in each meeting we held; there was a free flow of ideas that was met with both constructive criticism and ideas that built on from the previous ones. I think that from simply contributing well and being passionate and enthusiastic about the project, I was able to create a productive, yet lively environment.","As part of the Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Society, I had the opportunity of leading first year students at the camp they host annually. As leader of a group of 10, I led them through icebreakers and activities, leading in creating a supportive and energetic team environment. I connected to them through my own first year struggles and imparted advice and hopefully helped build a supportive network that the new students can rely on during their years at university. Finally, I continually checked on their wellbeing during parties, ensuring that any injuries were taken care of and that they were staying hydrated, etc. I hoped to create lasting memories and be a small part of the student's journey through university.","https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayden-ou-4643a4130/

This is essential for anyone hoping to have a career in the STEM fields. This program provides a combination of skill building and hands on work that I feel will greatly benefit me and give me valuable experience that I can carry forward through the rest of my career. In addition to this, I think the opportunities provided in this program will improve my chances of attaining an internship in an engineering field and possibly a graduate position in the future.","I’m particularly interested in developing professional skills such as resume writing, personal branding and networking. In the workforce, these are equally as important, if not more, than technical skills in the context of getting jobs and improving your position in a company. Resume writing is an important skill as your resume is often the first impression that recruiters or hiring managers have of you and it determines whether you get an interview. Personal branding is increasingly important as the workplace becomes more competitive, as it helps you stand out from the crowd if it’s done well. Finally, networking opens doors to many opportunities. It might help you get a job or just give you information that is useful to you. These skills are not normally taught, so this is a unique opportunity to improve your career prospects by getting an edge over other students/graduates. ","One example of when I worked well as part of a team was when I was an organiser for the VDP Charity Event at UNSW. I was organising a stall for the UNSW Vinnies Society with 4 other volunteers. We had to create an event to raise awareness and money for Vinnies. As a team, we brainstormed ideas and came up with a bake sale and a raffle. I suggested splitting up the responsibilities between each team member based on their skills. There were some members who were good at baking, and the other members were able to get prizes for the raffle. I was one of the people baking, and among us we decided to meet and bake the food together. Working as a team, we managed to finish all the baking efficiently and prepared enough to make a profit selling them.","In my first semester of uni, one of my subjects was a project where my group had to build and program a robot. We split the team into two, with some members, including me, building the body of the robot and the others writing the code for the program. We tried many different configurations of the robot and code, and as the deadline was getting close we started testing it. After a few tests, we realised that the code for the robot was not matching the way it was built. We had assumed that the members writing the code were changing it based on the configurations we were creating as we all worked on during the same lab, but due to a lack of clear communication, the program was based on one of the initial designs. As there was no leader, I stepped up due to my understanding of the design of the robot and programming knowledge from one of my other subjects. To try to solve the problem, I set up a regular schedule for the design and programming teams to sync the two separate parts of the project and avoid the same problem occurring again. After a few sessions of this, our project had greatly improved and the team was working as a cohesive whole. As a result of this schedule and our planning, we were able to finish the project a week early and it performed very well in the final assessments. I believe my leadership was instrumental in raising the morale of the team and effectively completing the project.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=18slS928Z4Cb3Fzo-3MfFeccZ8lHyEEfS

However, there is the large hurdle that is integrating and taking a strong foothold into the workforce that I do not know yet how to approach. 
I feel Real Skills Education’s aim to improve STEM students’ employability through the STEM Leaders Program; to bridge the gap between the theoretical in the classroom and the practical in the workplace, is a program I would greatly benefit from as I have next to no practical experience at all.
I intend to take my degrees to move towards biomedical and biotechnological fields in the future, to play a part in the development of Computer-to-Brain Interfaces to help the disabled and terminally ill, and would greatly appreciate a platform to place myself in front of potential employers and to network with fellow students, mentors, and industry leaders","I have limited work experience, and next to no practical experience within my industry or a professional network. As such, being able to accommodate for these shortcomings is my primary goal in completing the program.
Specifically, I want to gain skills in being able to give myself an edge over others in applying for internships and later on, other career options, not only through writing such as CVs and Cover Letters, but also through developing soft skills, such as in interviews and pitching of ideas.
I also want to gain technical experience within the biomedical industry to bolster the soft skills above, as first year university courses do not provide nearly enough knowledge in specific industries, and to learn how to establish a professional network as I understand the development of a world revolving more around who you know, instead of what you know.","I perform extremely well as part of a team, having been involved with volunteer teams regularly, completed a High Resolves Leadership program during high school, worked as a section commander and platoon sergeant in my cadet unit for 5 years, and am currently in an engineering group designing and building an EMG and Bluetooth operated bionic hand.
In cadets, I co-ordinated with a small team of 6 to manage a large scale cadet activity involving 150+ cadets in the field over radio telecommunications, relaying orders whilst addressing all navigational, situational and health related concerns during the activity and constantly updating and informing the other cadets in my team to establish an around-the-clock system to ensure the smooth running of the larger activity. This was done with no prior experience, but with co-ordination credited to have greatly helped the company win the Annual Field Expedition (AFX) of 2014.","During the cadet AFX of 2015, I took part in the role of a section commander, helping to relay orders from higher ranks to the cadets, and to lead the cadets and facilitate activities run for them. During the camp however, I noticed the behaviour of two cadets was indicative of self-harming tendencies, notably that one regularly stroked the slightly dulled edge of her army knife and another excessively avoided eating her rations, opting to give it away or not eat at all. 
Over the course of the camp, I spent extra time to ensure the two were able to be involved in all activities and feel as a part of a close squad, gradually redirecting outlets of self-harming urges towards more physical and emotionally beneficial alternatives, such as the reframing of apparently helpless situations to ones where the two were able to visualise solutions thus reducing self-directed negativity. Gradually, both cadets grew more enthusiastic towards each activity, volunteering for otherwise less desirable roles on the camp to help others out such as taking night shifts, and gradually stopped self-harming behaviour, where one decided to give me her knife permanently and the other began to eat her rations properly again.
Shortly following the camp, I could see that the squad had grown and worked extremely closely together, and the two cadets went to occupy leadership and mentoring roles of their own, such as becoming a corporal themselves, a senior peer mentor, running for prefect-ship, and even taking on forefront roles such as performing as a major character in school plays and becoming the school band director.",CV - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1a-99A6D8Tpn8Mqa3ZMdfp0nxum0p674N

It aims to introduce participants to the world of STEM disciplines which require innovative thinkers and creators to make a stand. By doing so, I believe they will be encouraged to become much more critically minded and open to challenges in the real world after University. It is also a worthwhile program which I think will greatly benefit me when searching for internships later on in my degree.","Upon completing the program, I would like to have experienced the real world industry and workplace, as well as receive hands on experience in my chosen field. Since the STEM Leaders Program is also a platform in which students can showcase themselves in front of employers, I think this will really aid me in bringing out my confidence and allowing me to be able to present my skills to professionals. This, I hope, will have the potential to kick start my career as I will be able to collaborate alongside industry leading firms and undertake real world projects, which will tremendously assist my future career development.","Teamwork is a crucial aspect of all STEM disciplines, and throughout my University studies thus far, I have had to participate in teams numerous times with people I did not know. In one of my teams for a First Year course, I had to be in a group with 6 others I had never met before. However, even in such a case, I believe I was a great team member and team leader due to my approach and attitude to all the other group members. I have always been one to resolve any dispute within groups when there are any conflicts, and I always take pride in becoming the team leader when I am appointed. An issue that often surfaced within that group was the share of the workload amongst members. Therefore, I decided to take the responsibility of distributing fairly and evenly based on each member’s strengths and weaknesses, thus resolving the issue.","As part of the team at U@UNSW Conference Program which I was nominated to attend in, I was a co-leader of various team based projects based on research and in depth analysis on current real life issues around the world. Due to my previous experience in countless leadership roles during high school, I was very fortunate to have had the ability to be chosen to become equipped with new concepts about leadership, initiative and effective communication from my co leaders. I was in charge of administering teams and scheduling various activities for members to do, as well as mentoring my group. This was a very valuable experience to me as I was able to collaborate with senior researches and lecturers to present solutions to realistic problems. Due to my leadership qualities and work ethic with my team, I was later awarded a Student Achievement Award Scholarship from UNSW for that program.

I worked well as part of a team during the Thales' Project Arduino where my team was required to design a prototype of a product related to Thales during a short period of time (3 weeks). I believe I worked well as part of a team since I required strong communication and cooperative skills whilst working on the prototype as team members had prior commitments and we were often unable to meet as an entire group.  I also had facilitated discussions and contributed to everyone's ideas and solutions. We ultimately developed a product we were proud of and contributed evenly to by combining all of our ideas.,"I demonstrated leadership skills during the mentoring program run by the Faculty of Engineering. I mentored three first year students during their transition from high school to UNSW. I organised meetups and facilitated conversations to ensure that each student was having a smooth transition into university. I motivated and guided the students and listened to their concerns and relayed advice. I also took initiative to introduce them to programs, societies and competitions around UNSW. Furthermore, I developed rapport with the mentees whilst remaining objective. I also observed the other mentors who had groups of mentees where one was less talkative and another continually overpowered the conversation. Though his leadership skills in communication and facilitating conversations, he was able to increase the confidence of the shy mentee by talking to the mentee one on one to develop trust whilst converting the questions of the other mentees into open questions for discussion.

Being a uni student; I have always wondered how my learning will be applied to the real world and I believe this will be a great opportunity to immerse theoretical content in uni with real world engineering firms and businesses. Specifically this will equip me with the skills to build upon and enrich my knowledge of how major corporations work especially the “behind the scenes” operations that enable a successful company. Through using this knowledge, I can appropriately apply myself to look further into possible career paths. The risk-free environment and  practical experience will be essential to truly assess the industry I want to enter. 

Ultimately is a platform to showcase my personal development in front of potential employers whilst having a great opportunity to network with fellow students, mentors as well as industry leaders.This experience is both highly valuable and important for furthering my skills in engineering. 
","The skills that I would like to gain and refine from this program are:
1.	Ability to work within a team environment 
Although I have extensive expereince working in teams for projects and events; I believe there is further room to grow and develop into an all rounded leader. Working with a team environment requires strong conflict resolution skills and I am looking forward to excercising these skills in the STEM Leaders Program.
2.	Strong communication and interpersonal skills 
We live in a society where its important to understand and communicate with people. But everyone is different. I would the opportunity to be able to compromise different ideas whilst keeping crucial common areas that interest both parties.
3.	Well- organised , detail oriented
Organisation and detail orientation is an ongoing battle as I have never been an organised person whilst my detail orientation has forced me to focus on details they do not have a significant impact thus wasting time. I would learn the ability to prioritise my time allowing for more organised routine whilst remaining detailed in specific important areas
4.	Adaptable to changing circumstances
I have learned the ability to think fast and logically and would like to refine this skill in the projects that we are given. This will ultimately allow me to develop a more flexible mindset.
5.	Strong professional written and verbal skills
I would also like the ability to produce industry standard material and I believe with these extensive mentors this will be a perfect opportunity to enhance my written and presentation skills.
","Teamwork can very easily make or break the success of an event. This will involve all members of the team to work hard and have fun in actively contributing to running these events. This year, I have undertaken an engineering project to prototype an Oscillating Wave Column producing 40km/hr air flow from a vertical air nozzle. Planning this major project was smooth as well as the initial stages, however towards the end, certain problems arose. One member of the team was adamant that a Tesla valve to be installed onto our device. However, this would cost precious time to 3D print whilst we only had one machine. I was able to come up with a design that utilised our existing resources whilst also integrating the tesla tube. The cohesion of realising what had to be done, who had to do the task and the holistically approach of completing the task was all broken-down step by step on a spreadsheet that I had designed to delegate the remaining tasks within the time-frame left. 

This has allowed me to develop and enhance versatile skills ranging from logically deconstructing the task given, critically analyse real life simulations while under pressure, marketing presenting our prototype, efficient story-boarding and crucial time-management skills. Teamwork is essential throughout the project I was able not only effectively execute as a team member but also mediate between any disputes.  
","I enjoy organising events and my leadership skills during the 1Scope O-week event allowed a successful week of raw sign-ups onto our database due to efficient marketing and the ability to engage the target audience. The idea was to create a novelty mechanic that allowed participants to take a very simple survey that took less than 1 minute to fill and then spin wheel to potentially win a reward. Through this technique, my team and i were able to increase engagement with the people of interest and I believe this skill of a clear vision despite pressure is crucial to any event. Most notably, the ability to force immobility of a structure during the final phase of an engineering project enabled my group to pass the course. As the measurements inside the chamber were inaccurate the device was able to move freely and cause structural damage. This was alleviated by wedging the nearest doorstop into the crevice between panels which prompted the mobilisation of our tested structure. 

My ability to perform under pressure is an asset that reassures my team. I believe that as a leader, your positive impact on those around you is defined by your ability to allow both you and your team to mutually understand and bond. This ensures minimal conflict and resolving conflict in the least destructive manner whilst maintaining a high level of motivation and satisfaction leading to an overall positive impact.

As part of this, I’ve sought out different opportunities to improve my soft skills and grow my professional network, which I believe the STEM Leaders Program will do. Additionally, the program includes a project that extends throughout the whole duration and includes valuable mentoring from members within industry, providing key insights into what holding a position may involve.","A key skill I’d like to improve are my presentation skills, which whilst practised can always be further developed. Communication is a vital skill in any field as it’s important to be able to communicate your thoughts and ideas effectively to others. Furthermore, it will allow me to more effectively sell myself and my ideas to potential employers. However, this requires me to have the necessary networking skills, which I also seek to develop, as the people you know can help shape your career path. I believe the ability to foster professional relationships and gain mentors in industry will be vital to gaining a foothold following graduation.","Previously, the EngSoc IT team noticed that there were various inefficiencies within the execution of various tasks such as merchandising and attendance and proposed we develop a solution. As such, we decided to create a mobile application and web app to service the growing needs of EngSoc. To do this, the mobile application team (which includes myself as director) and the web apps team collaborated in developing a shared API. This required significant planning and discussion to develop an efficient solution to the storage and transfer of data between our services and the application.

As a second-year student, this program is a great opportunity for me to gain relevant work experience and skills that would help me stand out from my peers when it comes to internships as well as to gain an insight into the workplace environment.

Furthermore, the soft skills and professional development workshops, as well as the Industry mentoring aspect of the program, would assist in my personal branding by equipping me with the skills necessary to excel in the workforce as well as the chance to learn from the best.

Lastly, I think by being involved in computing projects I would come to understand what aspect of computing I am most interested in and it would help me decide what major I should go for.","By applying for this program, I hope to achieve the following:

To begin with, I wish to learn how to apply the programming skills and knowledge that I have acquired from the university in the workplace and in projects.

In addition, I hope to develop expertise in different programming languages such as Python and Java, as well as front-end development languages such as HTML, CSS, javascript and jquery for example.

Furthermore, I want to become more proficient in c programming (the programming language taught at Uni) and develop my critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Lastly, I hope to learn how computer science skills are applied in different industries as this would give me an idea of how to best utilise the computer science half of my degree with the commerce (finance) half my degree.","While I don't consider myself as the MVP in team projects, I believe I still contribute a lot to the team's success. Generally, in team projects, I would offer ideas when appropriate, help struggling members,  complete my delegated tasks and think of ideas to achieve the team's goals. 

During high school, there is something called Market Day where students (in teams) would be responsible for having their own food stall and selling food to other students during lunch, similar to a festival. In the weeks, preparing for it I was involved in team discussions, in regards to what we are going to sell, tasks delegations and how we are going to operate. I convinced the team deserts were a good idea, as this could distinguish us from other groups which served mainly hot foods. I was also heavily involved in the team's marketing plan which consisted of promotion strategies, setting prices and where we are going to operate. 
","As a tutor (Shack Tutoring UNSW) this semester I am responsible for helping students with his/her studies and ensure that they keep on top of the school curriculum. I am responsible for taking a mentorship role and during every session, I would try to get to know the student better and develop a good relationship with them by having casual conversations with them and teaching them with a playful attitude as opposed to a serious one. 
Over the course of the program, I have observed increased motivation and attentiveness from my student towards her studies as opposed to the beginning, where she would be somewhat reluctant in doing her work (I assume part of this could be attributed to her understanding the material better now).

The STEM Leaders Program provides practical skills that are heavily applicable in these goals and the opportunity to collaborate with industry leading firms heavily attracts my interests in partaking in this program. Networking and Presentation skills are areas in which I find myself personally lacking and the opportunity to practice these skills among a friendly and welcoming environment further entices me. ,"LinkedIn, Networking and presentation skills are key areas in which I would like to gain or improve from completing this program. I feel that the recruitment processes for vacation/graduate positions for firms has moved towards technology as it enables a streamlined process in vetting candidates. LinkedIn is a professional networking platform that heavily assists candidates and employers in finding their suitable counterparts. Building connections at networking events is a crucial aspect in career development as it enables you to both find opportunities that aren’t advertised online but also finding new inspiration in your current field. In prior instances I haven’t had as much success as I would’ve liked as I wasn’t able to build the connections I had hoped.

My team was under heavy pressure given the amount of customers that crowded our work space and wanted to try on our products. My co-worker lost track of which customer he needed to serve next and a customer was very distressed at him for not serving her next. After noticing this issue and finishing up with my customer, I quickly moved on to serving this distressed customer, ensuring I LISTENED to her reasons for complain and catered my services as best as I could under the circumstances. She ended up very satisfied with the outcome and I feel as though it was attributed to our teamwork in serving our customers and putting our team members best interests above our own.","Whilst working at a telco I served a customer with a phone that was faulty under warranty. In his previous attempts, talking to my coworkers had resulted in no success in progressing his case. He explained to me that the warranty service covering his phone did not have any stock of the same model that was faulty and therefore could only offer a product of equal or lesser value. After checking my own store stock of the same phone, I decided to forward the case to our internal customer care line to see what could be done. After some time and negotiation, a solution could be reached where the customer could have his issue resolved with the stock we had at our store and he was heavily satisfied, and in future would only ever come to find me to service any of his telecommunication related needs. That day I felt like not only had I personally positively impacted this customer through reaching his desired outcome with some effort and negotiation, but also showed myself that by taking charge in a situation where I have the opportunity to do better for someone, that I am able to do so when the task is approached with the right attitude.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/zackery-kessey-b66129ba/
4/27/2018 23:57:56,Abeer Imam,abeer.i@hotmail.com,404523520,2,UNSW,Civil Engineering ,Civil Engineering,University Societies,I applied for the STEM Leader’s program so that I can be exposed to the real-life workplace environment. I aim to strengthen my employability skills through undertaking the assessments required for the recruitment process in the risk-free environment of the STEM Leaders program. I am interested to collaborate alongside industry leading firms as I tackle real projects and as a result gain a better understanding of what path in engineering I will be passionate to take. I strive to improve my technical skills and become a more innovative and creative individual and thereby increase my value to the industry I will be employed in the future. I am interested to portray my values and passion regarding a career in STEM to industry leaders during networking sessions. ,"I am interested to develop both my soft and technical skills from completing this program. I strive to enhance my presentation skills through ensuring the visuals in my presentation match with the information I am communicating. I also aim to increase my engagement with the audience through paying increased attention to my non-verbal behaviour such as facial expression, posture and stance, body language. I aim to learn the skills to tailor my resume application to appeal to the industries values through the resume building workshop. I intend to learn how I can modify my LinkedIn profile to better express my unique character traits and portray my values and passion regarding a career in STEM to industry professionals. Through the mock interviews I aim to learn to answer questions backed up with examples from past experiences, give concise and brief answers instead of rambling on. I also aim to become more mindful of my body language to be and appear calm and in control.","When performing as part of a team, I am a committed member who listens actively and helps the team to see the bigger picture. For example when involved in the EIP program, my team was focussed in seeing the value of implementing a wide range of solutions and were beginning to conduct the financial calculations and increase the level of detail in their solutions. I was able to communicate constructively and help the team realize that in order to create the clearest solution and a realistic implementation plan we should redirect our attention to our main points and from there if possible develop more points which branch out from the existing main ideas. In particular our team aimed for our client to form joint ventures with a large number of companies. I encouraged the team to focus our partnerships with 2 of the main companies which allowed us to explore specific risks specific to our chosen company and hence develop a stronger mitigations plan. ","I recently demonstrated successful leadership in the EIP this year. Initially I carefully considered the value of each member’s research for the case solution however when members decided to continue researching their chosen interests I took the initiative to step up and share my vision of what specific points have the greatest potential to develop an effective solution. Through constructive communication, I appealed to the team’s interest in seeing the bigger picture and thereby inspiring them to work towards a single vision.  For example when members had solutions which were too complex and contained too many interrelated ideas, I encouraged the team to focus on our single vision and remove the less relevant data to ensure our solution is more presentable and easier to understand. Furthermore I had identified the strength of each member and encouraged them to take tasks which suited their natural abilities. For example individuals who were effective in brainstorming were allocated to coming up with new ideas and individual who were detail oriented were allocated to roles in strengthening the existing solution and identifying flaws in the system, etc. 
Furthermore since members had a clear understanding of what tasks to execute, time and extra workload was not wasted on more irrelevant points. This allowed our team to practise our presentation skills ahead of our intended schedule, thereby infusing confidence in each member and further strengthening our understanding of our common vision to the case problem. For example in our eip case where we had to conduct preliminary research of energy resources, members were continuing to go into detail into energy sources that were clearly not leading towards the main solution.  It was best to help them realize this and for them to reallocate their roles to other sections sooner than later.

Additionally, since students will receive advice from experienced mentors, they are able to effectively follow their suggestions in future situations when in the work place. Lastly, by being exposed to a real-life project, students will also learn how to effectively map the solution to certain projects. Thus, all these are reasons which I applied for the STEM Program.","I want to enhance my skill as a leader as well as my collaboration skills as these skills are essential when working on team projects. Additionally, I want to further develop my communication skills in order to be able to broaden my social connections in the future. Lastly, I want to improve upon my problem solving skills because when combined with the previously mentioned skills, it will allow me to build an interactive environment where peers and myself, can confidently deliver and share intuitive ideas on how group projects should be approached and/or improved.","During Year 12 (2017), I was part of the Interact leadership group in which I strongly believe that I performed well as a part of a team. Essentially, the group revolved around organising charity fundraising events, which required multiple team meetings throughout the year. Within these meetings, every team member, including myself, gave their input on how these events should be organised while respectfully listening to everyone’s suggestions. Additionally, with roles being split the Interact team was able to successfully achieve their goals of helping issues within the community.","By being part of the Interact leadership group, I have helped address many issues in the community, the country and the world through charity fundraisers, which in turn, impacted me positively as it made me feel like a global citizen. Being a senior interact member, I was responsible for the event management team. Thus, I strongly believe that this is where I demonstrated my role as a leader as I was able to confidentially promote group discussions by individually requesting opinions and bringing together interesting ideas to further improve the arrangement of the events. Additionally, I was also able to observe the other leaders within the group encourage discussion within their sub-teams including brainstorming of issues with improper food hygiene, the possible risks present in the environment which the event will be held and how they will be prevented, and lastly, how the budget will be managed. Essentially, in this environment I was able to both demonstrate and observe effective leadership.",https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ah-HHynTfkACox8cVO0GkaJDutUM
4/27/2018 23:58:29,Nancy Shi Hui Zhuang,nancyzhuang9@gmail.com,466661803,3,UNSW,Bachelor of Civil Engineering (Honours)/ Commerce (Finance with Accounting minor),Civil Engineering,Facebook,"The reason why I applied for the STEM Leaders Programs (SLP) is due to the excellent feedback that I have heard, especially with regards to the numerous amount of opportunities that it provides. Admittedly, I have heard that the program is intense over the 5 days, however, I believe the rewards from the program are invaluable and would be extremely beneficial to my development. SLP sounds very practical, enabling individuals to develop their technical and soft skills – in particular, their presentation skills such as public speaking and providing a different approach to real life situations, something that university does not facilitate as much and an aspect that I would like I would like to further develop within myself. 

Furthermore, SLP enables students to take on a more hands on approach to their learning by enabling them to practice so many quintessential skills that are necessary to succeed in the workplace. As a student that is only halfway through a 6 year degree - due to a combined degree of Civil Engineering and Commerce, I believe it critical for me to continue to improve myself and I believe SLP will provide me with an abundant amount of opportunities.
","One specific skill that I believe is instrumental to career development and cannot be stressed enough is the ability to network with other individuals. Whilst networking is a term that is thrown about endlessly, the ability to successfully network is quite complex and personally quite foreign to me. Whilst I have heard the advice given to me with regards to researching the company, asking open ended questions, I believe I still have a gargantuan room for improvement and would highly value the opportunity to network in a risk-free environment, which RSE’s SLP provides by bringing in mentors. Moreover, being fortunate enough to hear mentors’ speak and learning from their experiences and be have their advice would be instrumental to my development. 

Indeed, another skill that I would like to develop on is my presentation skills, presentation has always been a particular weakness of mine. I would like to learn from SLP about how to present my ideas in a manner that the audience can understand – not simplistic but in a simple, concise manner. Hence, presentation and networking are the two skills that I would like to specifically work upon.","My performance when working in a team is satisfactory however I believe I can always further improve my ability to perform in a group due to the different group dynamics. Due to different personalities and mindsets, individuals must always have the flexibility to adapt to ethos and ensure maximum potential is reached. 

One time that I worked well in a team was when I was undertaking the group project for ENGG1000. My group was tasked with constructing a tower that would be able to take a certain load whilst under progressive collapse, as well as providing a report that would justify our design. As it was the first time I have embarked a project, my group was running behind schedule and needed to complete the construction of the tower as well as the report as soon as possible. Hence, I ensured that members were delegated components of the project that they had strong affiliations towards. One group member was proficient in Autocad, hence they were given the task to complete the drawings for the report, whilst another member were tasked with writing the report to ensure the continuity of the voice in the report whilst someone edited the report and ensured the formatting adhered to the standards provided. Hence, we were able to maximise our efficiency and completed the project within our tight time constraints.
","One particular situation which encapsulates my leadership skills was when I was organising the Opening Ceremony which involved over 100 industry professionals and students attending. In order to ensure everything ran smoothly, I held a meeting where I delegated certain tasks to members to ensure that all the necessary work was completed before the event. I created soft and hard deadlines before the event in order to give members, also university students, the flexibility needed to complete both their studies whilst ensuring the work for the event was completed.

Moreover, this would also facilitate the improvement of their time management skills. Indeed, I later followed up with the members after the meeting to ensure that they understood what was required of them and to check up on their progress. Furthermore, whilst ample time was given to complete the tasks, I also thought of contingency plans in case of any surprise obstacles such as members being sick. Hence, this empowered the members to complete the work and ensured a successful event was held.

I believe that STEM Leaders Program in Real Skills Education can provide me with a valuable experience to adapt to the professional skills for a workplace environment, as well as a crucial guidance for a competitive environment. I am a self-motivated and organised person who really want to obtain networking opportunities and enhance my skills by participating and learning from internships. ","
I want to develop a strong communication skill as it is crucial for working in a team, especially for being a leader. As a leader. we might receive complaints from other. I am urged to develop a better skill to discuss issues effectively as it can positively improve a team performance as well as the relationship between team member. It is also important to make sure that other members respect the leader, therefore I should obtain a strong persuasive skill to let the member have confident in their tasks and push their potential to achieve a higher sucess.","I have been an SRC member in high school, working in a team with other members as well as the school staffs has allowed me to test my teamwork skills and develop a strong interpersonal skill that benefits my future. After discussion and making a decision, we came up with the idea that we should have a paper recycling program in school. As an SRC member, we collect suggestions from friends and other students and generate a solution to solve the current problem. We made a timetable for making paper recycling bins and collecting the paper from each classroom. The paper recycling program is run successfully and it could not happen if we are not organised or cooperated as a team. we also ran activities, such as fundraising, talent shows and classes reunion.","Besides being an SRC member in high school, I can also demonstrate my potential to turn into future leaders in STEM field. I am currently doing Engg 1000 project for my first year. In my group, we need to design an efficient battery for a lego car by using different combinations of chemicals. At the beginning of the project, a team member suggested the person who possesses a native English speaking should be the leader of our group since our group is quite international. Later, I discovered that our group is lack of organisation and time management which disadvantage us to complete the group assessment to a professional standard. Therefore, I decide to schedule meetings and assign tasks for each team member who I believe they are adequate to do so. During a few lab times and meetings, I can recognise the strength and weaknesses of each person, so it can help me to maximise our abilities to achieve success as a group. I am also willing to get feedback from team members to make sure they are happy with the current situations. I obtain a strong coordination and organisation skills and mature attitude towards working in a group.
 In our group project, due to lack of presenters in our group for one presentation task, I updated the slides on the powerpoint and presented it successfully under the pressures of running out of time and public speaking. This can demonstrate my ability to be a leader as a leader should take appropriate action in unplanned situations and stay calm yet confident to solve the problems. As an active member of the team, I carried our team through the presentations and reports and take responsibilities for the decisions.  This has positively impacted my team as our team members are working more effectively and the leader is more engaged in the project.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaAk2EpOHViGtHUYfHbSJx0AMqGneQaqE1FxmZ9I_rg/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs
4/27/2018 23:59:25,Daniel Ding,danhehnad@hotmail.com,434450854,1,UNSW,B Civil Engineering / B Advanced Science,Civil Engineering,Friend,"The STEM Leaders program presents itself as an incredible opportunity for me to develop my professional skills as well as gaining personal experience in a work environment, which will undoubtedly be invaluable to me and my career progression in the future. I don't see many STEM related programs for undergraduates, as they're usually commerce/finance related programs, so I would definitely love to be a part of this opportunity to grow. 
I hope to eventually start a civil engineering related company that houses both contractors and sub-contractors, allowing for start-to-finish project solely through the company. 
Although this goal may seem far-fetched, I hope that through the leadership skills and business acumen that I gain in this career-orientated program will help me in the many steps I will eventually take to achieve this dream. ","I aim to gain two specific skills, along with many others - Communication and management. 
I believe that being able to communicate with your colleagues is extremely important, in both a professional environment and friendly environment. As I'm still young, I want learn how to be able to move between both more friendly conversations and industry orientated meetings. This will hopefully allow me to communicate my ideas or other peoples ideas in a more succinct and effective manner. 
Secondly, I believe management is crucial to any work environment, especially the STEM related sectors as often one project will range across multiple engineering/industrial disciplines, requiring effective teamwork and management for every section. 
","At my current workplace, I am involved in teaching Physics to Year 11 and 12 students, along with a small team of other tutors. Together we must manage our own resources and teaching plans, requiring effective communication of deadlines and quality control amongst each other. I'm personally involved with producing resources (e.g homework questions and exams) for the new syllabus. With this responsibility, it's imperative that the homework questions are released on a weekly deadline, and most importantly have the quality that our team would be proud of. To do this, I put an effort to ask for feedback on the quality of my work, and to also provide feedback for other tutors. A more specific example involves the Head of Physics requiring me to produce two exams within a week, due to an unexpected deadline coming up. We both worked together over Slack and Google Docs, providing updates and criticism on our work. We also made an effort to update the Directors on progress and expected completion time for each section. ","In my university Engineering project group, the group decided to elect me as the project leader/manager to oversee the project, which was to build a small solar vehicle.
At the start of the project, I allocated individual tasks to group members which would target specific sub-systems required of our vehicle, for example, circuity or transmission. I tried my best to accommodate for each individual's interests, e.g allocating electrical engineers work on the circuity. 
I worked together with a group member to produce a Gantt chart which would often be referenced to provide a framework for the deadlines required. I announced these deadlines often in our group-chat to help remind the team of the tasks that had to be completed.
I found that throughout the project, the most pressing issue that often arose was the need for individuals to communicate what they could and could not do within certain deadlines, instead of remaining quiet.  For this, I held a small meeting with the group, urging them to come out and talk if they aren't able to meet a certain deadline, as it's normal for anyone to feel overwhelmed with work and their own private lives, and that it's fine if they're not able to complete their work. I emphasised the importance of communicating this earlier rather than letting it snowball into a larger problem later down the line. 
This experience definitely helped me understand the unforeseeable internal issues that a team can have that are outside the project scope, which require good management and leadership skills. Often the saying 'What can go wrong, will go wrong' applied to our group and our endeavours, which required many plan B's and C's. Overall I do believe that our team had a rewarding experience and lots of fun making this project, and it was thanks to the effective management skills and communication that we had amongst each other.","I don't have a completed CV at the moment, sorry!"

By taking part in this program, I am able to be alongside professionals and thus gain a deeper insight in networking with others and collaborating in a team. Furthermore, I want to strengthen my communication and problem-solving skills which this program will successfully help me to achieve by the end of it by participating in activities to gain practical experiences. These skills I will learn in this program will then be utilised in finding a job or an internship within STEM. ","I want to enhance my communication skills particularly networking with mentors and industry professionals so that it can aid me in my career development. By learning and strengthening these skills, I hope to be able to collaborate with a dynamic group of individuals in order to achieve a particular task or project to its best potential. By strengthening my communication skills, it will not only allow me to go further in the future but will also allow me to work on my leadership skills as well as being a part of a team. ","In high school, I did debating for six consecutive years and that involved working with a group of three individuals including myself for one hour to plan a debate. This means that working in a team was such an important skill set to have in order for the ideas to be stated in a respective manner. That being said, I perform well as part of a team because I was able to listen to everyone giving their ideas and arguments about a certain case and then provide constructive criticism on the ideas that had put forth with each other. I also allow other members of my team give me feedback as well whenever I have ideas and opinions on the topic we are debating. I think I work well as part of a team because in most of our debates, we win in it and there are rarely any arguments we have in our team. ","In my final years of high school, I was an Amnesty International Leader. This means that every fortnight, I would bring a group of at least thirty students together to write a letter about current world issues. I find these letters online at the Amnesty International website and then get the students to copy it down or write their own letters about the problem. I would then send these letters to certain embassies in relation to the issue including war, unfair persecution, and humanitarian problems. By getting a group of students together and sending these letters off, I always have a sense of achievement because I know that no matter how big or little I contributed to society, I know that I have made a positive impact on the individual that I wrote the letter about. Furthermore, I have also observed a student in my high school who organised a blood drive where she would bring a group of students together to donate blood to the Australian Red Cross for people in need. By observing her doing this, it made me feel so happy about that change that is going about in society, improving the quality of life for individuals.

Additionally, it provides me the chance to personally develop through providing training aimed at improving my interactions with others in such a manner that allows me to become more confident in a leader's role, as well as exposure to and interaction with likeminded individuals who also seek to benefit from the program - creating possible business contacts for the future.","The primary skills I would like to gain through the program are those that would assist my chances in the career application process, in particular development of confident interview skills as I believe I am lacking in my networking skills and how I verbally present myself to potential employers. In most team situations I rarely take the leadership positions due to my independent nature, so I would also greatly benefit from learning the skills needed to become a more effective, likeable and supportive leader for others.","I believe I work efficiently and effectively as a team member since I do not find it difficult to cooperate with team members and adapt to their unique methods of working as a team. An example of my flexibility with other team members is an Engineering project I am currently undertaking with 5 other individuals to design and manufacture a battery. Throughout the project, each task was split up to different members based on their knowledge and personal areas of strength rather than randomly, encouraging me to work promptly and enthusiastically on my personal tasks for the project as well as contribute to team meetings with cohesion and detail. ","Throughout my casual employment at Ticketmaster, I observed a high quality of leadership at multiple levels that influenced and guided me towards displaying some actions of leadership to less experienced employees in our workplace. When issues would arise I would consult my supervisor who would often provide me with advice on how to handle the situation if it is to occur again. An example of this was the supervisors tips on how to advise customers asking about refunding tickets, where with the knowledge I gained from their past experience I was inclined to change my tone of voice and the way I communicated to customers to make them feel more at ease. Additionally from gaining this experience from more senior members, I have been equipped with basic supervisor skills that have allowed me to instruct other, less experienced colleagues with the same suggestive pointers and technical IT skills (replacing printer paper, troubleshooting PCs etc.), allowing me to remove some of the workload off the supervisors while they attended to more serious matters.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/15J_fW8d4jXYY9PNvkJDvD1WkFCZYyaCzjARKQJkqpCo/edit#

The career workshops, pitches and industry networking opportunities hosted by the Stem leaders program sound very unique and as an aspiring Stem leader I’m highly curious to get more experience with industry and discover more about my field. I believe  team experience and industry engagement best improve soft skills and this benefit is invaluable and much unalike anything in a classroom setting. Overall it is because of my reciprocation of the importance of skills beyond the classroom reflected by RSE’s mission statement that I wish to be a part of the Stem Leaders Program.","I wish to take the next step with Real Skills Education and develop my personal brand of leadership, teamwork and soft skills further through the STEM Leaders Program. I recognise there are many skills to refine to succeed as a STEM professional in industry and I wish to grow these skills through the experience from working in a team of like minded students with industry mentors. This program provides a safe environment to accomplish this and I’m highly interested in participating so I can challenge my own viewpoints and grow as a person and a STEM student. Thus by completing the STEM Leaders Program overall, I wish to evolve my existing skillset and perspectives so I can be the best me possible. ","I consider myself to be a great team member who strives to be selfless, positive and a good communicator. An example is in my workplace, I am junior software engineer at an information systems firm specialising in retail leases. Nicole who is a mother of 2 primary school girls has a degree in property law and her role is to be a lease administrator for the database. Together we work on maintaining the database, however she struggles with technology. I worked with her to develop scripts to automate her tasks. However, this would not be possible if I didn’t understand her needs and did not alter my approach to her individual use case. This helped us both become more efficient at our job as I in turn learnt from her. This taught me to understand fellow team mates on a more personal level.","Coming out of secondary education I decided to reinvent my professional skillset and pursue my passion for computers while having little technical background. This was a difficult transition and during my first and second years I had very little industry experience and knowledge of how I could apply my interests to industry. During this period, I engaged in a program at UNSW called Heroes, which was a similar initiative designed to improve your soft skills and technical competencies. In this program I collaborated with 6 other members from different technical backgrounds and individual styles to strategize and design an innovative solution to improve university life for students. I had to become a leader for my group which involved project planning, technical design and presenting the pitch during the final day. In this role initially we were highly dysfunctional as our collective lack of vision was not unanimous. The key to an effective team I realise is to balance personalities, skillsets and not to enforce my own vision on the team. Together we successfully collaborated to present our final pitch.

Being able to market myself as a potential intern/employee on LinkedIn is vital to help secure an internship and I believe the STEM Leaders Program is definitely an experience that will help me in that regard. Being able to improve my LinkedIn through the introduction of industry networks and experience gained through working on the case in the STEM Leaders Program are two immensely useful areas that will help create a positive impact on my personal branding in a professional regard.,"I wish to further improve my presentation skills and leadership ability throughout the STEM Leaders Program. As a current participant in the Engineering Industries Program (EIP), I have had some experience improving my presentation skills through the use of custom slide decks and speaking skills through bi-weekly case competitions. As mentioned in the two RSE workshops throughout the EIP, there are always ways to improve presentation skills and the most important one is to practice. Working in the STEM Leaders Program will definitely be one of the most rewarding and fulfilling experiences for presenting and I intend to make the most out of this program if I succeed in entering. There are not many chances during a university degree to develop leadership skills, so working in a small team during the STEM Leaders Program will be beneficial in learning to work as a leader and is an experience that I am sorely lacking in. ","I believe I work well in a team due to my strength in working independently and as a team member. An example of this is when I participated in a hackathon run by Innovation Dojo in March 2018. I had formed a small team of 4 with two members from Japan and one member from Australia. Each of us had different backgrounds, with me being the only member with an engineering background. Due to our different skillsets, we delegated tasks to each member based on their unique skillset. I worked on the technical side of the solution and solved it within a day and helped my teammate achieve the same goal. Due to our early success, we were able to help the other members create the presentation and that gave us more time to practice as a team and help fix each other's presentation skills.","As mentioned above, I had participated in a health hackathon run by Innovation Dojo in March 2018. One of the examples of leadership that I saw in my team was when the team had trouble deciding on how to solve our problem from a technical standpoint, as the hacktahon required that we have a presentable solution by the end of the second day. We had consulted with a multitude of coaches throughout the first day. For the majority of coaches, while all of their advice was useful and insightful, their responses did not pertain to the problem we had and had asked them to help. One coach, Meow-Ludo Meow-Meow, had given us some after listening to our problem and suggested the use of blockchain technology because it could be done within the timeframe of the hackathon. Whilst his advice was simple, he actually listened to our problem and gave an answer specifically to help us fix this problem. I believe his response showed two good traits of leadership: the ability to listen to a team's problems and why ""T-shaped"" people make good leaders. A ""T-shaped"" person is a person that, as I heard through Meow's presentation during the first night of the hackathon, has a base understanding of different disciplines and areas of knowledge whilst having a very deep understanding of one specific area. Meow is a great example of this. He is known for his expertise in the relationship between biology and humans and has experience of other topics such as electronics and software, which helped him come up with the blockchain solution to our problem. He also helped most, if not all, of the other teams come up with their solutions and, as a result of his influence, the end product from each team consisted of high-quality solutions.

I have participated in a similar program before which was less related to my future career and field of study, and so I would relish the opportunity to immerse myself in a data science/statistics related project. ","It would be great to develop my personal brand and build confidence in networking, but the best for me is to have the chance to work on a team project closely related to my future field of study. Being able to bring something to the table in a hard-skills sense is as important as the soft-skills interactions with people in industry. ","In 2012 and 2013 I was part of a winning team for my age divisions in the East Hills Boys Mind Marathon tournament. As a team we were tasked with completing an exam which was impossibly long for a single person or for multiple people to work on the same things at once, so we saw fit to delegate sections of strength (based on a topic, like geography, mathematics, or science questions) to less vocal but highly intelligent and under-represented members of the group. In the end, our delegation of work meant that we were one of the few teams even to complete the paper in the allotted time, and in both competitions we finished in first place.","At the start of 2018 I participated in the UNSW Hero Program, a team-based extracurricular initiative requiring research and preparation of a pitch to be presented by one randomly selected team member. 

I informed the Program leader that one member of my group had been absent for most of the project, predicting that it would not be fair to the rest of the group if a barely present group member were to take credit in the pitch. Although the Lead was not willing to remove her name from the random draw, we compromised that should she be selected, we would reach an agreement to change the speaker with the consent of the person chosen.

This scenario took place, inducing great stress in the rest of the team members so close to the date. There was further animosity in the group, as the member expressed interest in doing the pitch despite having not put work into the project as the rest of us had.

Following my negotiations with the Lead, however, I was allowed to negotiate also with the group member, informing her of the team's concerns of her potential absence on the night (due to her work), and knowing her temperament, I chose not to engage her lack of a work ethic. She agreed and as a group we chose our own speaker, resulting in greatly reduced stress levels prior to the pitch night.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bSrtBnrZV-e1IjpHjsyMlG9obzSGw9iW/view?usp=sharing

I am not able to figure out the reason for rejection and what areas to improve on, so that I can be selected. I think this program will help me realise those weakness where I need to focus on. I am eagerly waiting to secure a internship. It says 35 % have secured internship roles after this program and want to be counted in that percentage.","As answered in the previous question, I do not know exactly what I am looking for. I want to do the program and realise the weakness myself because none in the market has pointed out a skill due which I face rejections. I want to explore a bit more about myself. ","Trust is the main factor which I believe should exist between team members. If that is lacking then even though the team has talented people, the team cannot produce a outcome as the team is disintegrated. I take responsibility and back up people in the team to work towards the common goal. I take the lead if I see there is none in the team to drive the team.",Leadership has become a big and is often looked upon as a burden in the society. It can be small things that can bring a smile in others people lives. I help my friends to understand the concept in academic study and they come to thank me after the exam with a smile.

Having worked with like-minded individuals who bears similar interests and passions, it was truly a blessed experience. What attracts me to the STEM Leaders Program is that I get to work with these type of people. Not only am I passionate about technology and science, I know that this is the pathway that I want to head to. This is an excellent opportunity to find out what I am lacking while working with the best of the best. I undersand that I will be working with professionals whose values also strongly align with my goal of making an impact in the technological world. 
I want to learn as much as I can, challenge myself and exceed my own limits. I know that attending this program is the best opportunity for that to happen.
","The main skill I want to gain from this program is the ability to bring the best out of a team. I love working with other people and I definitely see myself being the leader of a team or group in my future workplace. The most important attribute that defines a great leader for me is the ability to bring a team together and motivate them such that we can all bring out the best of each other. Having experienced being lead by leaders who could bring out the best of everyone as well as leaders who couldn’t, I know that I want to be one that can. I also want to learn how to manage myself as well as my team better under high pressure situations. How well I can handle these situations will often make or break the success of the team.","I perform the best in a team environment as I genuinely enjoy working with others. There was a time in my part time job when a few of us had made a mistake that lead to a customer essentially losing $700. We had to do something about and I took the initiative to take charge of those who were responsible to try fix the situation. I communicated between us, our manager, more experienced members of the team and also the customer. We managed to diffuse the situation which resulted in the satisfaction of the customer as well as maintaining the integrity and reputation of the store. As a team member, I worked well because I reached out and accepted other people’s help and opinions while keeping everyone updated. It was also important for me to make sure everyone had the same goal, that was to keep the customer satisfied.","At the Accenture Technology Academy Bootcamp I was part of a 7-person group working to come up with a client solution. We were reaching the deadline but every one of us still had our own parts to finish and we had nothing to present. We needed to be able to present our work as that was a very important requirement. I took the initiative to gather my team and hold a meeting. I told them that we were all focusing on the problem too much and that we forgot the whole purpose of this event. I needed to remind everyone of the presentation and its importance as it was meant to piece all our work together. After reaching a consensus, I gave everyone an hour to wrap up what they were doing and delegated tasks for everyone to do for our presentation. I made sure to frequently check up on everyone and reconvened at certain times to discuss how we were all going and what else needed to be done. What appealed to me as great leadership was the fact that I took initiative, delegated tasks based off everyone’s needs and compatibilities. I had also kept everyone from straying by having all of us take a step back to analyse our actual goals and what we needed to do to reach it. We ended up with a great presentation which contributed greatly to us coming 2nd place in this event. ",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jfapShPiNMnzNUoPW-njvaO-tUUxH3Ii

Having heard reviews from couple of friends that already did this, I have confidence in saying that SLP able to provide and guide me to become more professional afterwards in an enjoyable and exciting manner. UNSW had provided me with a platform that allow me to grow intellectually but society and programs like this allow me to grow my personality to become a better professional. The addition of external parties coming from real industry, I believe that SLP will provide me more than just a personality development but also knowledge in engineering field given by real professionals. In less than 2years, I will be graduating soon and I think the job market is far complicated than what it used to be 20 years ago so it is important to be prepared and programs like this would definitely give you a head start.","In general, I would appreciate any skills that I could have from the program itself but looking at the design of the program, I am particularly interested in developing my interpersonal skills and people mastery such that I could improve my communication and relationship between colleague. This is very much important in the real world as communication and understanding each other opinion is crucial. The program also offer discussion between each member and mentor, so I would also want to develop my confidence in public speaking. This is one thing that I lack since I did not enroll myself in many opportunities to evolve my public speaking. With the involvement of industrial giants, I hope I could get a grip on what the industry out there looks like and what are they’re expectation when they’re hiring someone such that I could put this to my benefits later when I’m graduating","In a team where I am not familiar with, I would be very cautious but not in an unfriendly way rather than to assess the person first regarding their skills and not easily believe on what they said. This was based on a personal experience where person that often endorse their skill excessively often couldn't do better than those who remain humble. To get to know each other, often I would talk with them personally to know a little bit of the person as knowing someone better means allows you to understand them better. Once we know each other, I would discuss our problem together as a team and work to find a solution effectively and I would be more confident to be engaged with my team.","My high school wasn't a big organisation so we didn't have much on leadership opportunity but during my first year at UNSW, I joined UNSW Sunswift. This had changed the way I see role of a leader forever. I remember the leads who affect me so much, Simba and Adam. These leaders guide me towards my first year at uni by not being a leader surprisingly, but as a friend and a mentor. They create a work atmosphere that made the team feels like very much open to new member like me that just finish high school and barely knows any knowledge about making racing cars. They guide us as in we're like long lost friends which make me learn much faster than I was in lecture and this opportunity gave me a head start during my 1st and 2nd year which I'm grateful. Growing in Indonesia, we're always exposed to environment where leader is meant to be a ruler but Simba and Adam had changed that perspective to leader is mean to be a guidance. This opportunity made me want to become a leader; hence, I decide to join Indonesian Night Market(INM) 2017 Committee, one of the biggest event in UNSW as a member. A sad truth that during my involvement in the event, members was oppressed and the status of leader as a ruler was very apparent which made me feel that something had to change. This was when I joined INM 2018 as a director with intention and believe that a welcoming environment and to be a friend and mentor. We managed to create a good working and welcoming environment unlike in INM 2017 and as predicted, the event was a huge success and I feel that I had made a positive impact on new members.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ma9gVsNMEfLY9CFTU_m7Z8n-Noast_R_/view

As a first year student with very limited knowledge and experience, applying for STEM Leaders Program is a highly beneficial decision that can help deepen my understanding of the Engineering industry through teachings such as employment related knowledge and tips that will set me apart from other applicants. ","From this experience I hope to gain valuable long-term relationships and leader skills to prepare me for real world challenges, such as being able to accept a great amount of responsibility and to consistently deliver under high pressure. My incompetence towards efficient time management and prioritisation skills deter me from undertaking greater employment related challenges, so I would greatly benefit from learning how to manage a leadership role that comes with a sense of organisation. Additionally, within the group project aspect of the program, I want to further develop my communication skills and gain the ability to effectively establish a good rapport with my peers through learning how to interact with others in a variety of professional / business setting. ","I believe that effective communication is paramount in maintaining team cohesion and definitely leads to enjoyment whilst enabling fruitful discussions. My continual involvement in social settings such as working at KFC and volunteering for peer tutoring/support, demonstrate my passion towards developing my interpersonal skills and the practical utilisation of these skills to help improve the wider community. Working as a casual in fast food (KFC) allowed me to develop my teamwork and interpersonal skills through engaging with customers and fellow colleagues, leading me to believe that I work cohesively as part of a team. Due to the fast paced working environment and expectations of providing a satisfying customer service experience, I have learnt to communicate with team members and think analytically in high pressure situations, allowing me to contribute to my team by providing a solution to certain workplace problems while keeping calm and level-headed."," As part of the IMI/JK Academy Dance Team, I learnt to appreciate how team cohesion and taking initiative to reduce discordance can culminate in the success of a team. Initially, members would fight for the centre position, leading to arguments and poor performance if they were placed on the sides. This brought dissatisfaction towards our overall performance and our the teacher deemed us unequipped for competition. Consequently, many students stopped turning up for practice. I mediated this issue through personally messaging my team members and communicating the importance of team cohesion rather than the distinction of one individual. I integrated position swaps and developed a new position plan where the strong dancers were scattered to showcase a more uniform choreography, allowing everyone a fair chance to shine. Eventually, my demonstration of leadership and taking initiative paid off as our teacher was very delighted to see the team's improvement, we won 2nd place in the Sydney Super Star Dance Competition as MODE.L (My Own Dance Expression. Ladies).

With my degree finishing next year and the need for me to undertake a 12 week internship to finish my degree I have found out that I am severely underprepared. I haven't had any experience communicating with people in industry to properly present myself and my ideas that are vital for me to succeed. I am looking to give myself the best chances of making it into a STEM job and think that the STEM leaders program will give me the best head start I need.,"The skills I want to gain to aid my career development are in professional communication skills. I want to improve my ability to network between people in the industry so that I may be able to access more job opportunities that are not available on the normal advertised job market. I also want to be able to best present myself to people to most effectively secure internships, graduate jobs and communicate my ideas in a professional way within the work force.",One time i worked well within a team would be during my engineering design course in my first year at UNSW. During this time I helped the team through constructive conversation. After creating a surveying balloon we had to write a report to document and present our creation. I took it upon myself to work out the strengths of the team by asking them of their strengths to fairly and effectively distribute the workload to most effectively and efficiently complete the task getting the best critical thinkers to work on the most technical areas and those with the best cad and presentation skills to present the report in the best way possible. We also came up with a review scheme to look over each others work in meetings to get out the best work of each of the members. it is this foundation and nurturing of synergy that creates a good leader.,One time last summer I have witnessed strong leadership was on a very interesting day at surf life saving patrol. I chose to go on a roving patrol down to the headland by myself and discovered a surfer who had fallen off his board and hit the base of his spine. I tried to convince the man that he had injuries that could be life injuring and that he should see an ambulance but he would not listen. upon contacting the patrol the captain took charge commanding the situation. He motivated me to take the situation more seriously allowing me to relay to the rest of the patrol accurately my position and the situation of the surfer allowing me to better perform in the situation and allowing the fluid coordination of the whole patrol. He then also demonstrated great tenacity as he raced down the beach with me to track down the surfer as he was about to leave. He was then able to convince the man that he had sustained a very serious injury that could affect him for the rest of his life and helped him around to the next beach where he was tended to by the ambulance impacting the man by potentially saving his life. His charismatic command to strongly conduct situations and compel those around him to work together effectively aids everyone at the beach which i find very admirable.,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Fn2jq0BoXbQ6OGyQKJLgWvWBTqFw0Nr/view?usp=sharing

Heading into my penultimate year, I wish to improve my teamwork, communication and analytical skills to be more competitive when applying for internships and graduate positions, which I believe the STEM Leaders program can help me achieve. Furthermore, the STEM leaders program also provides an opportunity for improving networking, self-branding and presentation skills, all of which can help further my professional career goals. The notion of being able to complete a real-world project as part of a team under the guidance of a mentor also appeals to me. Having already helped many STEM students towards achieving their goals, I am eager to experience this program that is being offered by real skills education. ","This program would be able to help me develop numerous skills to aid in my career development. One major skill I seek to continue improving on is teamwork, through the industry projects I would be able to contribute to as I participate in the 5-day program. Through this experience, I hope to broaden my perspectives on the problem-solving process and gain further technical skills along the way as I interact, participate with and learn from my peers. I also wish to use this opportunity to broaden my network and get to meet like-minded people. I hope to improve my public speaking and presentation skills through communicating my ideas and solutions to potential employers. Finally I hope to get a solid idea of how the theory I have learnt from university could be applied in a practical scenario as I learn from mentors and industry leaders the program provides. ","As a team member, I am very flexible, able to take the role of a facilitator or just a contributor. I work well with different types of people as I am open to new perspectives and willing to adapt to any new suggestions that could potentially be better. I work part-time as an academic resource developer in a tutoring company. This role requires me to work in a team of tutors and managers to ensure the highest quality resources are provided to students. This role requires me to constantly work with tutors as they communicate student feedback combined with their own suggestions, to which we discuss and brainstorm ways we could improve the lesson structure and content. I strongly believe that the major reason why my team worked well is the fact that we all were receptive to ideas and willing to communicate.","Leadership is a term that encompasses many different things and during last O-week, I volunteered for AISEC UNSW, an organization whose goal is to develop leadership in youth through experiencing this exchange. During this time, I was exposed to many different styles of leadership and what they mean to different people. I learnt the strong values that leaders have and their passion for what they are trying to convey. I learnt about the different qualities that leaders have, including having self-awareness and a solution-oriented mindset. Finally, I observed the different ways to lead people and how a movement is created through having the courage to try something new and inspire others.   In turn, I was able to demonstrate leadership, as I conveyed the organization’s views to new students during o-week. I was also able to keep motivated throughout my volunteering experience, with my positive attitude being transferred to my fellow peers, ultimately improving productivity and group atmosphere, something which I am proud of.

However, this program will allow me to work with people from different backgrounds and mimic industry level projects. 

As well as that, I would like to develop my presentation skills and networking skills. The environment would definitely allow to me to strengthen these skills. ","I am very comfortable in working as part of a team. Recently, I have had the opportunity in participating in the Engineering without Borders (EWB) Design Corner.

I have chosen my majors to be Finance and Business Information Systems. But, to be honest I do not know much about these industries. I have applied for the STEM Leaders Program because I think that it will broaden my interests in the Information Systems industry as well as introduce myself to new fields of interest that I have not yet encountered. Currently, I am also considering transferring to study a double degree in Commerce and Civil Engineering and I strongly believe that the STEM Leaders Program will allow myself to gain deeper insights into the different fields of Engineering.","Through completing this program, I am very keen to develop my personal branding and networking skills. My first networking event was in Year 12 when I was one of the few High School students selected to attend the UNSW Capital W 10th Anniversary Annual Dinner Event. This event was my first step in to the corporate world as well as the entire idea of ""networking"". Soon enough, I realised that networking was a critical part in career development as it gave students the opportunity to ask their burning questions to representatives from highly reputable firms. I also believe that personal branding is a skill that complements networking skills very well, and so I am willing to improve these specific skills through the STEM Leaders Program.","In my fifth week of University, I was selected as Events Director at BusinessOne Consulting Group at The University of Sydney. As a first year, I felt very overwhelmed by being positioned on the Executive Team for a society. My first task was to organise a Customer Consulting Workshop for Student Consultants as well as Consultants from a corporate firm. For this event, I worked together with the Internal Vice-Presidents to confirm the venues, dates, time and catering. I also had to work with the Treasurer to ensure that the expenses for the event were within the assigned budget. As for the Marketing Team, I had to talk them through on booking photographers for the event so that photos could be uploaded to the society's social media accounts. Considering that it was the first event that I had run as an Events Director, I think I did a satisfactory job as there were no people or resources that went missing on the day. ","In late 2017, I undertook the role as Booth Captain in the North Sydney Council election. Throughout the afternoon of the election day, two other election teams became involved in a verbal fight which made it difficult to campaign not only for their respective teams, but for my election team as well. At the time, the two other Booth Captains were in their mid 50s, whereas I was only 17 years old. The verbal fight became very large that there were Police officers who had been called onto the election site. As the only other Booth Captain that was there on site who was not involved in a verbal fight, I had to step into the argument between the two other Booth Captains and mediate the conflict between them. The process was long but, in the end I was able to steer the two people away from their opposing opinions and convince them that the purpose of their roles was not to voice their own opinions and argue that their respective beliefs were superior. But rather, that their role as Booth Captain was to make the election a smooth and easy process for members of the local community.",www.linkedin.com/in/heejin-chang-33061115b

The SLP is mix of all those and more so I would like to apply for it.","I would like to learn communication skills and teamwork skills the most, I think these skills are essential to a successful engineer. Writing skills are also high on my list because I currently lack those. Last but not least I would like to develop engineering skills for my future carrer (especially writing programs for real-world environment and mechanical design for production).","Unfortunately being the leader of a team (especially the human resource side of matters) is not what I enjoy doing, but I do feel totally comfortable being in charge of the technical side if the situation calls for it. For instance, in the MMAN2130 team project, I was involved in the design and manufacture of the product. Through the semester I offered help and advice to my teammates about 3D modelling, machining. I also worked as a coordinator between teammates designing different part of the product to make the manufacturing process simpler and more precise. During the machining session I reacted to unforeseen problems that emerged from the machining process and quickly came up with new methods to improve the final product.","To my knowledge I am the first Chinese to design, build, and compete with a combat robot in Australia, and I have inspired other people to try this engineering challenge. I constantly post my latest design on the Robowars Australia forum and communicate with other roboteers. I entered Robowars 2017 to show that any college student, even without power tools on hand, can build awesome projects like a combat robot. After seeing my robot a student from USYD (who is not an engineering major) took interest in combat robots and I began teaching him the fundamentals and giving him a head start. I am a firm believer of the idea that anyone can be an engineer so the fact that I have piqued interest in non-engineering students makes me happy.",Sorry I don't really have a resume now. As I said above writing skill is something that I would love to improve upon during the program.

I want to maximise my learning from university by applying theory to practice. For the first two years of university, all I would do is attend lectures and not apply what I was learning to real life. It has only been in the past year where I have realised that I learn the most when I’m doing a project where it is not as straightforward as answering exam questions. As an example, this semester I completed an assignment where I had to stitch images into a 360 image. Although it was extremely hard, I found it very rewarding because I was thrown in the deep end and was forced outside my comfort zone. I know that this program will offer me the opportunity to push myself to outside my comfort zone and accelerate my learning. I also want to work in an environment that is not only driven but fun to work in.  ","The two key skills I want to gain from completing the program are my technical and social skills. Firstly, I want to learn more about programming as this field has huge potential in making social impact. I also want to learn more about data science and it's applications to real life. What got me interested in data science was when I took part in the Westpac Case Competition. It was fun and challenging to use a data driven approach to find the best charity to donate in. Secondly, I want to develop my social skills because I want to ability to convey my thoughts and ideas in a efficient manner. This is something I've been working on for a long time now and I will put maximum effort to learn as much as possible.","One time I faced a problem was when I took part in a business competition called the Uber Launch Challenge. In a team of 3, we had to make a start up pitch to Uber about shared ride products. Due to the fact that I was in a hardworking team, I had to learn to quickly adapt to a high performing environment. I knew I had to work harder to ensure I was a high contributor. Therefore, I put extra time outside of meetings in order to perform to standard. I distinctly remember working for 3 days straight with 5 hours sleep on each day. I also made sure to ask smart questions to maximise my learning. Ultimately, I was commended for my hard work by my team members and we landed 2nd place in the national finals.","One time I demonstrated leadership was when I took part in the strategy& Case Competition. I had to provide advice to a client that is trying to enter the Australian energy market. This was the first time I was working with the people on my team and I knew that in any team situation, communication is crucial. The challenge here was to make sure everyone was comfortable to express their own opinions and not be reluctant to disagree when they wanted to. I had to take initiative to make sure there was a a consistent communication with my team members. I would make sure we bonded outside our team meeting and suggested we have lunch together and talk about things other than the case. As a result, everyone got along and I made sure I actively listened to everyone's opinion on our strategy. Ultimately, we all had fun and learnt a great deal about the energy market.

Although I have completed several projects as assignments in university, I would love to understand and practice real life projects as they would differ in many ways from university projects. I am also aware that we would be assigned to mentors who will give me insight into what their work is like and information on various roles. Although it is a short program, I see this as an essential experience in deciding which direction I want to head after completing my study at university.","From completing this program, I hope to gain experience in networking and working in a real world cooperate environment. Intense workshops would expose me to skills that may not be covered in university but relevant in real life, and despite my previous experience in group projects, I know I'd always learn something new and adapt to different styles of working. Meeting mentors and other students also would naturally let my networking skills to develop which I'd appreciate.","I've had to complete group projects in various courses (in computing and psychology) as assignments and also have retail experience that required me to work in a team. During group assignments, there was a time where someone was not contributing to group work at all. While some suggested to take that problem to tutor/lecturer, I initiated communication with that particular person to try raise our issues and come to a solution. From that conversation, we became aware of the person's reason to why she was not able to contribute and allocated tasks that could be done later and we were able to complete the assignment and all receive distinction.","As well as the previous example that I believe I have demonstrated leadership by stepping forward to resolve an issue, I have other situation outside university that showed my leadership.

While she listened to the customer's complaint, I remembered a similar situation and offered her several options she could take that my colleague could not think at that moment. Within a couple of minutes, she left the store happily and we learned it's important to step up and suggest any ideas when a sudden issue arises. Our manager was quite happy with us, so since then we are both put on days where the manager is not available and other team members also feel comfortable directing customers to more experienced members when they are unsure which action to take.",https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qMNnvFUcRm_zBsTzLkd4IvgNNNeL4o_z?usp=sharing

An overall learning experience to either build or understand personal strengths and weaknesses as I believe the program would be about. ","I want to gain an understanding of new/unknown team working environments by entering this program. For example, I aim to put myself in a team environment that is unknown to me which, through this program and working with multiple members and diversity, I aim to find skills I am lacking and through experiencing them I will learn how to handle these situations. This will greatly aid in my career development because I understand Engineering greatly requires the ability to work in new/unknown team environments and this program can prepare me for these conditions.","As apart of a team, I usually conduct interactions between members to build rapport. For example in MMAN3000, being assigned in a group of diverse people - interaction was low at first sight. To accelerate productivity, I would actively meet my group members individually, understand their strengths and weaknesses and bridge connection with those of common interests. This builds rapport and ultimately allows team members to build rapport between each other and understand what roles are most suitable for each member. Ultimately, deadlines for group assignments were reached unforced, with simplicity and ease. ","From previous experience, I have been told I am efficient, collaborative and able to make choices from my peer evaluation. Going back to a previous team working environment I have apart of is MMAN2100, whereby work ethic was low due to the inactivity of our assigned team leader. Due to this, I took initiative to plan dates ant times to do group meetings, start discussions as a group and ensure each member is approaching a common goal and set deadlines. Deadlines assigned by me were always 2 days before it was required, this gave leverage for unseen circumstances or delays that may be encountered.

However, I am quite lack of working experience, although I am studying in the school for 16 years. Therefore, I really want to apply my  knowledge to the real life and find my deficiency under the working circumstance. I think the STEM Leaders Program is really appropriate for me because it is a great opportunity to understand how STEM programs work and improve my abilities and skills to solve engineering problems, moreover, I can know what I should do to improve myself. On the other aspect, the experience working in a real stem program is quite significant for me a future engineer to be familiar with the engineering pattern and will give me lots of benefits for the future work.","During this program, Firstly, I really want to improve my Matlab skills because it is very helpful for me to solve some complex issues for instance, biological engineers aims to detect the biological signals within humans' bodies, and then they have to analyse the signal. During this procedure, Matlab is the main software to analyse the signals, however I am quite bad at writing Matlab codes. Therefore I am eager to improve my skills at this field. Secondly, I want to improve a series of abilities which can help me design scenarios to solve specific issues. This means I prefer to be a designer or a creator rather than a common worker who only needs to finish the jobs from the superiors. Because I reckon a good engineer is able to understand every part of a program not only the part he is responsible for and he should be a master of creation.","When I was a undergraduate student, my team was asked to design a poster for an activity which was held by our institution. At that time it was a relatively tough task for me , because I never designed such a huge poster and the poster would be criticized by the whole institution. Hence, I had to seek advice from all kinds of people including my teammates and also searched a large amount of information online. I tried to spent the minimized time to finish the preliminary draft of my part and then asked my teammates for advice. And then I redesigned my part not only to increase the quality of my part but also make my part better integrated into the whole poster as we were a team and each of us should cooperate well with others. Finally, our poster was recognized by the majority professors and students. Moreover, my teammates and I built a very good relationship.","When I was an undergraduate, I joined in the student union of my institution. The main duty of our department is to design various posters or painters for different activities. My leader was a very kind female student called Miao, because she never shown her arrogance to other students. Moreover, she was also a master of Photoshop and she taught the skills of Photoshop to other teammates without stint. Therefore every one was willing to devote their spare time to design new posters with no pay. During the design process, we could express our own feelings about the posters and gave our own advice. Our leader Miao was very patient to listen to our ideas and she would give a final decision. Due to Miao's personality, the efficiency of each student was quite high and this was the reason that our poster were all high quality and got recognized by the majority students and teachers. The great relationship was also established among us during the period which we worked together. I got a lot of fun with my teammates and this period of experience left lots of good memories. Unfortunately, our leader changed her major, hence she could not be our leader any more as a result, a senior student became our new leader. He was also quite good at Photoshop but he always shown his arrogance towards other students and he was not willing to have fun with other members. After a short period, lots of students chose to leave our department including me because we could not stand to work in such an environment which was full of dispute and no happiness. This experience made me understand the importance of a good leadership. A good leadership will increase the efficiency and give each member opportunities to improve their abilities.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wq91_FZpDwjD-NtHFDjoka6jrqKIR5rBx8vYVHuxBzc/edit?usp=sharing

I am passionate about my professional development and eager to use and expand on the technical skills I have learnt to tackle industry related problems. I also like the challenges and achievements that come from working in teams to complete a task. So pretty much I have decided to apply because It think I can learn a lot and have a good time. ,"
1.	How to network.
2.	Leadership skills, for industry related problems.
3.	Public speaking and presentation skills.
","I enjoy working in a team environment and get along well with people. I like to freely share my ideas and openly receive feedback and criticism. I am an active listener and think everybody has something valuable to contribute. This semester I am currently doing the sumo bot challenge(robotics challenge) at UNSW, my team has three people and our goal is to build a sumo bot. To keep the team on track I have being organising our weekly meeting setting out what we need to bring, do and accomplish during each meeting so we can meet our milestones. By being organised and taking the time to plan everything out I have been able to maximise our productivity. Another example of when I worked well was when I used my own technical skills to solve a problem we had with some Arduino code thus allowing us to reach a milestone. ","I am currently part of BLUEsat at UNSW (the space engineering society) where I have observed leadership that has positively impacted myself and those around me. BLUEsat team leaders work together and manage people to complete very complex tasks such as building a sophisticated robot or providing technical training in the form of hands on lessons to members of the society. Using leadership qualities such as good communication skills, commitment and creativity the team leaders at BLUEsat have created a fun and engaging learning environment and built some awesome projects.

That is, with this opportunity at hand, I intend to grasp on developing my current skill sets and diversifying my experience through the interaction with like-minded people. I know that with this STEM Leaders Program, I will gain an insight on the complexity of leadership within STEM and be further enticed by the challenging environment and projects. Thus, I hope to professionally develop myself to prepare for the workforce and to showcase that a leadership role in STEM is possible. ","From the completion of the STEM Leader Program, I intend to further enhance the essential skill-sets required to excel within the workforce. That is, I hope to develop professionally through the understanding of personal branding and the ways in which to network effectively. Not only that, I anticipate on developing a relationship with like-minded and highly motivated people. This way, I am surrounded by a group of potential leaders in which can inspire and challenge me for the better.","I believe when I am situated within a team environment, I attempt to listen and gain an insight on my group’s strength and weaknesses. I always try my best to get everyone involved and ensure that each person’s idea and queries are brought up. My performance as a team can be reflected through Cabramatta High School’s Hospital Appeal. This fundraiser was a student based project and it involved the students organising and running a garage sale to raise funds for Christmas presents and essential hospital equipment for the Children’s Ward at Liverpool Hospital. I had the opportunity to gather the 30 volunteers. It was challenging to delegate roles that each student was content with. Hence, I took time to build my understanding of everyone’s weaknesses and strengths by having regular meetings with plenty of group activities. This in turn, allowed the group to successfully raise over $4000 for the Children’s Ward.
","I believe the best kind of leadership is one in which the individual completes a small act of genuine kindness. I see this purity within my little sister, as I believe that she has continuously demonstrated leadership skills that many people cannot achieve. That is, her honesty and willingness to speak values she stands for creates a more fulfilling and reassuring environment within my home. This has eventuated to a more positive environment within my household which is reflected through a stronger relationship amongst my siblings. This is an essential leadership skill that I believe can relate to the workforce as a more fulfilling and reassuring work environment can lead to a greater chance of a company’s success.

Whilst studying my degree, I feel a lack of practical applications of my learning to real-world situations, and I believe this program will help fill that hole. Additionally, I would like to broaden my understanding of the chemical engineering industry (and engineering in general) by working with industry professionals who could aid and mentor my journey, and to provide opportunities for self-development and to develop interpersonal skills.  ","From this program, I would like to strengthen my leadership and communication skills, as these are key qualities which are sought after by employers in an engineering graduate. Unlike other professions, I understand that engineers often have to work with a mixed of people of different cultural backgrounds. Hence it is extremely important for an engineer to be able to adapt to any team working environment and have the open-mindedness to accept everyone’s thoughts. Therefore, I believe these skills can be developed through this program by working in a team-based environment.","I enjoy working in a team and interacting with people with similar interest or a common goal. For an engineering project, we had to design a ramp which could transport and launch a golf ball as far as possible. In our newly formed group, two members were exceptionally dominant and would often reject other member’s opinions and ideas. Seeing that multiple members of the group were annoyed, I stepped in to explain the importance of each member’s opinions. I’ve emphasised the importance of having the team be on the same page, in order to work more effectively. By allowing the dominant individuals to see my reasoning, my team was able to express more ideas during the discussion period, and this was essential to the later part of the project in which we had to physically construct our designed ramp. Therefore, by resolving this conflict, we were able to work more as a team, to achieve the same goal. ","An example of when I demonstrated leadership was during a “Lipton” barbecue fundraising event for the charity “Food Bank”. Since it was a fundraising event, the food and merchandise that we offered were not free and this discouraged a large number of students from buying the food and as a result, we did not receive many donations at the start of the event. Additionally, we had seemingly too many idle volunteers (including myself) and most of the main roles (cooking and cashier) were occupied. Hence, I took the initiative to walk around the barbecue area to advertise our event. A couple of volunteers and I even took some Lipton tea drinks to the library as an attempt to sell the products. We were able to raise some donations, however I also saw this as an opportunity to raise awareness of our event. Eventually, more people were aware of the barbecue event and were interested in our lowly priced Lipton Ice Tea that we offered. Hence, I saw my actions of advertising the barbecue as a success and we were able to raise a significant amount of donations at the end of the event. This example demonstrates my initiative as a leader and how it has influenced and sparked action of those around me to do the same.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oiTCVYd15eJRIaWW8pOnA-spCNLh9WDg

I am an Events Subcommittee member of the UNSW We Act society and earlier this year our event’s team was asked to organise a launch party. This involved booking a room, organising catering and creating games. Being our first event as a team, not all of us had met each other and initially there was a lack of communication between members. Taking an initiative to engage the team in the event, I organised a group call, during which we were able to decide on the logistics of the event. To ensure transparency and effective communication within the team, after the group call, I summarised the structure of the event which we had discussed and delegated responsibilities for purchasing food and creating templates for the games we had agreed on. After making this document available to all team members to view and edit, I updated our President on our progress.","Earlier this semester, the first stage of our Introductory Econometrics Project was for our tutorial class to collectively submit a request for data to our lecturer.

Collectively as 25 students, we were given half an hour to discuss the problem given to us and produce a data request, which would be graded by our lecturer. Given this short period of time and the fact that most students did not know each other, communication during the class discussion was initially minimal.

In order to engage discussion, I took on a leadership role and asked others in the class their opinions on the questions for discussion. During the discussion, I also took the initiative to collate the class' ideas in a Google Document. Realising that not all team members had had an opportunity to contribute to the discussion, at the end of the tutorial,  suggested that the students note down their email addressees so I could add them to a google document. This was an effective way to ensure everyone had the opportunity to collaborate and contribute to the final submission document. 

The idea for the Google Document was a success, as our entire class was able to contribute to the submission and we received full marks for our Data Request.","Nikita Kapahi

I am a high distinction average student with a strong work ethic, passionate about the field of engineering and how it can affect others. But the lack of direction and guidance that I experience at university is something that is personally frustrating. Having a mentor would help me grow by helping to identify my strengths and weaknesses outside the realm of academia, open my eyes to opportunities that I would be passionate about, and allow me to interact with a group of eclectic, brilliant people that I wouldn’t otherwise encounter. Furthermore, the program would allow me to improve my communication skills, facilitate the application and growth of my problem-solving skills to real problems, and most importantly for me, learn what it means, and takes to be a leader and to lead effectively.","I want to learn how to develop my unique personal brand and effectively convey it. I want people to be able to understand what I stand for, and the things that make me tick. The first step in achieving that is to understand myself. Nearly everyone who studies engineering cites “making an impact on the world,” as a motivating reason. But I struggle with the question of how and where we as individuals can make an impact in the context of our unique skillsets, values and passions. I also want to learn how to ace interviews and effectively communicate aspects of my skillset that they actively seek. Finally, I want to grow my problems solving skills by learning how companies such as Arcadis/Accenture approach and seek to resolve complex problems systematically, as well as improve my knowledge of useful prototyping methods such as 3D printing and skills such as HTML.","I perform excellently in a team. Throughout my university career I have been involved in a huge variety of teams each with their unique set of goals; from summer engineering design and university demonstrator teams, to inspiring high school children by communicating the role of STEM in upholding social justice and changing the world with YSA and EWB. One of the most exciting teams I’ve been a part of is the MiniEpi-Inc team, when I cofounded it in 2016 with Sammy Seeto and Andrew Fong, the current director. I was an integral part of that team because I was able to understand Andrew’s vision and motivation for the proposed development of the MiniEpi auto-injector, materialising it by playing a large role in the development, prototyping and research phases of its design. I actively applied my creativity, was always eager to learn new concepts and met all my deadlines on time.","Being a Young Scientists of Australia staffie was one of the most eye-opening leadership positions I had been put in thus far. In this role, I was responsible for the facilitation of a three-day science camp for over 100 high school science students alongside 20 other volunteers. I interacted with many high school attendees with an interest in the prospect of pursuing a STEM degree. As a mechanical/biomedical major, I am highly passionate about employing mechanical and biological principles to develop devices that create positive change in addressing global health and humanitarian issues. I attempted to pass on this enthusiasm by communicating the importance and the tangible impact that a STEM degree can have on the world, especially to the most vulnerable. The role taught me that being an effective leader requires you to motivate and light a fire inside people, as simply telling someone to pursue their goals will never have the same impact as inspiring them to do so. To serve as an effective YSA leader, I also learnt that those who you are leading need to trust you for that leadership to be effective. Their inspiration tied into their trust in my passion and enthusiasm as a leader in my area of study, imploring them to explore the significant impact they could possibly impart using their career. One of the most profound things I learnt was that real leadership wasn’t about lording power and your position over the people beneath you; real leadership is using your position to effectively serve those you have been put in charge of.","Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuapham/

My current course of engineering design at UNSW requires us to create a bionic hand throughout the course of the entire semester in a group of 7. Throughout the semester, through interaction and cooperation with my team, we were able to produce a cohesive presentation for our project proposal, earning a mark of 4.3/5.  Mentors also complemented our design which was largely the product of ideas from all team members. Through this process I was motivated and contributed more than I would have ever done for myself. I  learned and accomplished things which would have never been even considered without the help and interaction with my team.","As a former prefect of Macquarie Field High School, i have both demonstrated and observed strong leadership throughout my schooling career and continues through my tertiary education. During the impromptu design day for the Egineering Design course, a group of students were placed in random teams to create a design to catapult a load. The team i a part of consisted of 8 other students who initially stayed reserved especially due to a language barrier with half of the group. As a bilingual student, i was able to communicate with everyone so i organised the team into those who would like to complete calculations and those who would like to contribute to the design component. Everyone then began working in their respective group yielding a semi-functional catapult made out of paddle pop sticks, straws and cups and elastic bands also a completed set of calculations. I've also witnessed a proficient leader in my Engineering Design project group. She is able to delegate roles and work extremely efficiently amongst the group whilst minimizing conflict through adjustments and compromises which either enhances the group progress or enriches the individuals.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEQi-tp5fmQL-vbuvLi7UN94hIwbqu_BMKeVlInFjBQ/edit?usp=sharing

I originally chose to study electrical engineering because I wanted to contribute to the creation of things which are useful, and while studying has granted me with a lot of knowledge, I have not yet applied this knowledge to many projects which I am truly passionate about. The STEM leaders program would allow me to develop skills such as teamwork and lateral thinking, which are highly relevant in my field of interest. Collaborating with fellow peers to work on a meaningful engineering project sounds like an exciting opportunity and I’m hoping it will allow me to demonstrate my ability.","I hope to have a career working in the application of cutting-edge technologies. The STEM leaders program would allow me to work on skills which I do not commonly use, which are consequently some of my weaknesses. These skills include creativity, teamwork, leadership and lateral thinking. I feel that these skills are highly valuable to my field, but opportunities to develop them are far and few between. Furthermore, I have had little experience with job interviews and professional networking, and hope to develop these skills through completing the program. ","When working as part of a team, my approach is to be empathetic, and accepting of people’s ideas and opinions. As part of my coursework at UNSW I completed a group project, with a team consisting of 7 fellow engineering students and myself. During this project, I assisted in the equal division of work among group members and was given the responsibility of booking and organising meeting areas to discuss the progress on our individual sub-systems, and potential issues anyone was having. In brainstorming sessions, I made a conscious effort to be open-minded, and to provide constructive criticism where necessary. We agreed to deal with conflicts through a discussion of pros and cons, followed a majority vote. Through this, everyone felt that they had an equal input to the outcome of the project, which was ultimately very successfully.","During my time as a high school mathematics and physics tutor, I have had the opportunity to teach students of a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives. Since the subjects I teach are quite abstract and challenging for most students, I devote a lot of time to the development of effective teaching strategies, and devising ways to present ideas in an intuitive manner.

This year, the New South Wales Education Standards Authority (formerly the Board of Studies) has implemented a revised, and radically different physics syllabus which focusses largely on the analytical aspects of physics. Throughout school, I often felt that there was a disconnect between the physics being taught at school and the physics we see every day, so I took it upon myself to develop teaching materials for this new syllabus. I developed these materials with a focus on students gaining a holistic understanding of the material, which was achieved through explaining the subject matter in terms of ideas learnt in previous years, and everyday occurrences. 

I encourage my students to think critically about the subject matter and to ask questions as much as possible. I have facilitated this by setting up an online forum where students can ask myself or each other questions relating to the subject. I also provide free consultation for students after classes, so that they can clarify any doubts they may have. So far this year, my students have on average scored 14% higher than their peers at school. It is very rewarding to know that the extra effort I put in to helping my students has made it easier for them to digest complex ideas, and that they are achieving excellent results.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FWEczKbpDUenDEZp3XnOnrDlO3gIyUTb4gN5L3lc-Rc/edit?usp=sharing

In deeply reading into the STEM Leaders Program I know that, if I get chosen, I will be given the opportunity to achieve these invaluable interpersonal skills and help me build the bridge between university and the workplace. I am determined to engage in the professional engineering environment by undertaking projects and solving problems. This program will allow me to work with likeminded individuals that will help me grow as a person both personally and professionally.",I want to learn how to present myself in a professional manner to employers and ultimately perfect my personal brand.

I haven’t had much experience with resume writing either and would love to get some advice on the information I should be providing to future employers and companies.,"The incident that a few of the surf club members and I encountered last year while patrolling is one example of my ability to engage with diverse individuals when performing as part of a team. 
At the beach were faced with a situation where we needed to help a person in need. A boy approached us with a sore neck and a dislocated collarbone. We immediately called the ambulance and, as a team, undertook a spinal injury procedure. Our team was aware of the concerns and needs of the patient throughout the procedure and this was highlighted through our ability to take on different roles such as supporting his head to avoid aggravation of the spinal cord and keeping our patient calm. Working efficiently and communicating effectively by keeping in constant communication with one other was what enabled our team to bring him to the ambulance safely without any further injuries that might have occurred otherwise.","My peer support program experience throughout high school has highlighted my leadership qualities. My fellow peer and I organised a variety of self-development activities for year 7 students every fortnight to build improve upon their strengths and overcome weaknesses. It was very rewarding to watch my year 7 students, whom I had taught throughout the year, transition comfortably from primary and gain the power to overcome problems that they were faced with in high school. Students felt comfortable to approach me with different issues including bullying that I was able to act upon immediately. 
As the year 7 students learnt to develop deeper and more trusting relationships with their new peers and motivate team members to challenge themselves in ways that produce positive outcomes, I myself learnt that being a leader has encouraged me to be the best person that I can be and has emphasised the qualities such as benevolence and empathy that I am proud to possess.
I believe that I am an enthusiastic and passionate person who takes great pride and joy in helping others and guiding individuals to see themselves through a brighter light and I hope that I am able to further my leadership skills through the STEM Leadership Program.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yrih5KmndVz2xEaFxAWtcPryugSjQpOo

It sounds like an awesome way to kick start my networks, as well as improve/develop my soft skills, resume and presenting skills. I have only currently started to develop my portfolio (linkedin), and my resume to make sure they integrate all of the necessary skills that i've learnt and developed while studying at uni and being part of engineering societies such as BLUEsat, but i've got a lot to improve. ","I would like to mainly improve my personal branding, networking and communication skills. Being part of  small team working on developing a project in a condensed time frame would be a perfect method to go about developing these skills. I feel like my current skill sets are alright, but i lack the knowledge and ability to successfully sell my self to possible future employers. I would love to develop my skills in being able to talk to them confidently, with a  smooth flowing train of thought. I understand that this will take a lot of practice and experience to pull of, but the stem leadership program would be the perfect place to initially develop these skills, which i can them hopefully build up from. ","As part of the ENGG1000 (design project), my team and i decided to undertake the advanced computer science project. This required us to design and 3D print a small rescue bot that was to be operated by a raspberry Pi. The focus for us was to integrate a rubber band powered suspension system to enable greater manoeuvrability.Given a short time frame to complete this project (2 weeks), it was necessary for us to break up the workload with half of the team working on developing the code and the other half working on designing and learning to 3D print it. I was in charge of making the design and 3D printing it. I delegated different tasks to my team, and had to make sure everything fit in together. We also had to communicate with the coding team to make sure all the components had a place to live.","I am currently and executive member (Arc Delegate) of a student-led space engineering society called BLUEsat at UNSW. We have an awesome President leading us through all the current changes happening. We recently moved rooms due to renovations and started to plan new events (showcase) that will enable us to publicise ourselves to the industry.  She developed and integrated positions and jobs, that will separate the workload from one person, and has overall made sure she improved our foundation to make it better structurally. She has really motivated me into spending more time at BLUEsat and helping it progress, as it genuinely is another place that i can call home.

In particular, I hope to refine my resume, improve my interview skills, enhance my networking skills and boost my presentation skills. Through the multitude of opportunities this program offers, I believe that I can improve my soft skills and employability. Fitting with RSE’s aim of bridging the gap between classrooms and workplaces, I think it is important to develop and improve these skills that can’t necessarily be taught in a classroom. Since engineering roles involve working with others, academics by itself is not enough to be proficient. This means that interpersonal and communication skills are pivotal when working in this environment. In my opinion, this program would allow me work on these skills this through the team project, collaboration with industry leading firms, and professional development and technical workshops on offer. Each of these target key areas of improvement and will allow me to showcase my ever-expanding skill set to potential employers. In addition, this program offers me a chance to experience the real-life workplace in a simulated environment; enabling me to gain practical experience as well as scoping out what the electrical engineering industry has to offer. Having heard of the rewarding experience this program offers, I strongly believe that my involvement will thoroughly prepare me for upcoming summer internship opportunities and help me stand out from other applicants.","Upon completion of the program, I hope to gain a wide array of career relevant skills that I would typically not be able to develop in a classroom. These include soft skills such as communication, critical thinking, leadership, teamwork, work ethic and positive attitudes. I expect that the activities within the program will help me develop these skills by challenging me and pushing me to strive for excellence. I am looking forward to the group project task and think it will be a great opportunity for me to improve my presentation skills. It will also give me a chance to pitch an engineering solution to an industry leader in an engaging and charismatic manner. I would also like to learn on-demand skills within the industry such as coding and CAD. I hope to improve my resume and cover writing skills through the relevant professional development workshops. I wish to gain a better understanding of personal branding and how to successfully market myself to potential employers. By working with other students as well as industry partners, I think I can improve my networking skills allowing me to pursue exciting opportunities and ultimately help me find my place within the industry.","In my opinion, I am a strong team player that performs well in a team environment. This is because I possess qualities that make me an excellent addition to any team.  My dedication and commitment means I'm highly motivated to finish any tasks assigned to me within the specified time frame. This was evident during my time as a Events and Publicity portfolio member in Stationery Reuse Centre (Arc volunteering program). The portfolio’s goals were to plan and host environmentally engaging events for the UNSW community as well as organising social events for bonding and interaction between members of the program. To achieve these goals, the team needed to brainstorm, organise and delegate tasks among its members. During discussion, I actively listened to the ideas of other team members and encouraged their contribution. When I presented ideas, I was open to criticism and flexible to adapting my ideas to the suggestions of others. In the rare case of conflicting ideas, we discussed the positives and negatives from each idea to reach an agreeable outcome; incorporating the best parts of each to reach an amicable solution. I believe that my good communication skills and positive attitude allows me to effectively collaborate with other team members and work together to achieve the overarching goals of the portfolio.","I am currently the Environment Portfolio Leader in the Stationery Reuse Centre, an Arc volunteering program that provides free recycled stationery to the UNSW community. My team's goal is to ensure that the program is as environmentally sustainable as possible and also to run workshops to educate the UNSW community  about how to upcycle old stationery. The management and leadership of a team tasked with these responsibilities is vital to ensure we meet our KPI's and achieve our goals. Under my leadership, we have coordinated multiple successful workshops and implemented more environmentally sustainable initiatives within the program. I have been able to create a highly functioning team by establishing a strong foundation and facilitating the four stages of team development; forming, storming, norming and performing. I started off with creating a harmonious team dynamic. This involved plenty of ice breakers and persistence on my part as a few members were shy at first. From there, I introduced SMART goals and clearly communicated the direction I wanted to lead the portfolio. This set the expectations and brought everyone on the same page. Through clear communication and abstraction, I was able to facilitate constructive discussion and delegate tasks. This coupled with a strong team dynamic allowed us to run unique and innovative workshops such as ways to re-purpose a ring binder folder. One of the issues I had to overcome was the scheduling of the team's weekly meetings. As my team comprised of a diverse range of students, finding a common time that everyone was free was a little challenging. By being flexible on my part, I was able to lead by example and encourage my team to find a common time when everyone is available for the meeting. In addition, I have also adopted Slack as a platform for productivity and take advantage of technology such as online meetings and Google Drive to ensure that all members have access to the meeting even if they can't physically be present. The culmination of all these things has led to the successfully leadership of the portfolio, and I believe that my leadership in this role has positively impacted its members to strive to be the high achieving team it has become.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ClcKO8KuoNdQn_o7GhRins53bTkxbL82

It would also allow me to gain insights into industry leading firms representatives about their career pathways and how they applied their technical and soft skills as one of their means to achieve their career pathways. ","I would love to through this valuable experience, further enhance my soft-skills and gain further team working experiences and make life-long friends whilst gaining an insight into real-world engineering consulting by undertaking real projects. Specifically the program will allow me to further develop my public speaking and pitching skills, because I believe these skills are one of the most valuable skills in the marketplace for modern day engineers, as it is about the effective communication of one’s ideas across to another, which is essential in not just the professional workplace, or business, but also in my own personal life and relationships as well. Additionally good resume writing is a skill that I predominantly lack in and through this program I am aiming to further develop this skill, which will allow me to secure that internship that I am so eager to gain. ","I believe I perform well as part of a team as I exhibit strong commitment and reliability. Specifically I demonstrated these attributes when I took part in the I4C Westpac Case Competition. I displayed strong commitment towards this competition, as I was happy to research and meet up for hours leading to at one point working on the case for three consecutive days with limited amount of sleep. Also due to one of the three-team members going through a very bad breakup I took it upon myself to take the brunt of the workload to decrease hers as she personally needed time for herself and did not need the additional stress. I believe details and actions like this illustrate how reliable a person is.  Ultimately through reliability and commitment we were able to complete our presentation and progressed through into the next stage of the Case Competition. ","A time where I demonstrated leadership that resulted in positive impacts is during my time as acting manager at Just Sports when we experienced low sales. Due to low sales and constant pressure from the owner, low team motivation and conflict started to occur. I overcame this challenge by holding a meeting with all workers and setting the expectations and responsibilities (target sales and morals) early on and making each work colleague to write a commitment statement to the team’s goals and objectives and to keep it with them. To further combat this challenge, practicing mutual respect and accountability within the team was also helpful. By setting these expectations this ensured the team to avoid common challenges faced by other teams and led to our store meeting its target sales consistently whilst also having a friendly and motivated team environment. 

A time where I observed leadership that resulted in positive impacts is during my time participating in the summer program UNSWOT. As a team of 12 different personalities is expected and differing opinions is inevitable. However this escalated when four members were frustrated at one another due to their differing commitment, opinions and general personality clashes. Due to this conflict one team member decided to call for a group meeting. He instructed the whole team to sit within a circle and told each member to express their opinions and give a “compliment sandwich” to each member they had a conflict with. Even though this was such a basic and minor action, it managed to dissolve the conflict as each member started to empathise and understand each member’s perspective with a calm approach. Through this experience it showed me the importance of communication and how beneficial a minor gesture of listening and compromising can be to a team environment.

I am aware that these skills are essential for successful career developments and as such, I am determined to present myself as a strong candidate in the evolving industry to secure internships and jobs. After being exposed to some professional environments from my participation in previous programs such as UNSW Heroes, I discovered that I had a lot more to learn outside of academics. It is something that I want to pursue further, and I wish to challenge myself to new experiences where I would have the opportunity to further develop myself personally and professionally. I am excited to meet like-minded individuals throughout the program and collaborate alongside industry leading firms where I hope to learn in an enjoyable environment.","Leadership: Leadership is a skill which I have seen people around me express effectively, whether it would be from peers in team-based projects or from industry leaders around the world. As a result I have witnessed the effectiveness of successful leadership and it something I would like to develop.

Resume Writing/Personal Branding: I have always strived to build up a resume for my career, but many others are doing the same thing. I want to learn effective ways of expressing myself in a resume and as a result, present and distinguish myself as a strong candidate in the industry.

Networking: I have had many chances to meet people from the industry and people from similar environments that I had worked in, but it seemed difficult to market myself as someone memorable. I want to learn ways to make valuable connections with people that can aid my professional development.
","I believe that I can perform to other people’s expectations in a team. I worked on a project that aimed to develop a chatbot that would solve communication issues between a student and a lecturer during the UNSW Heroes Program at the start of this year. I was able to execute my role in the team well, as well as cooperate with the other members to tackle any challenges we encountered. Each person was allocated a specific task to work on, but we allowed some flexibility so that we could all assist each other in case if someone was unable to meet a deadline. For example, I was primarily distributing surveys, but also assisted with the development of the chatbot and design of the slide deck/infographics. I was able to provide and receive constructive feedback well, so that we could continually improve on every aspect of the project. This allowed for efficient completion of tasks and a successful result.","An example of great leadership that positively impacted people around me would be during the same project for UNSW Heroes Program. We assigned someone to be our group leader as we decided it would have a better team dynamic. She had a strong sense of responsibility and organisation. She was able to acknowledge everyone’s opinions and ideas and provided us a direction to follow from that. For example, the first process was to brainstorm some ideas. Everyone’s ideas were taken into account, so no one was left discouraged which created a positive environment. We were able to sort through each idea and provide feedback and criticism for each one and ultimately decide on something to pursue. When working on the project, there were many attributes that needed to be completed, such as programming the chatbot, designing a slide deck/infographic, preparing a script and acquiring feedback from the student community. Our leader was able to effectively allocate people onto specific tasks with some flexibility based on their skills and what they were comfortable with. She set deadlines based on a schedule so that we could manage our time efficiently and also left some extra time for any unexpected problems. When problems arose, such as difficulty with programming the chatbot, she was able to consistently communicate with the team to make a decision to prioritise on the problem without compromising anything else. Overall, she showed immense passion for what we were doing, which really resonated with the rest of the team and allowed us to perform more efficiently and build trust among each other. She always thought about what the next step was and constantly pushed complete each task. We were able to cooperate well due to the great dynamic team environment she created. We presented our project with minimal difficulties in the end.",www.linkedin.com/in/justisnguyen

However, as a 3rd year student, the first two years of university have been laced with a noticeable disconnect between where I am and where I would like to be. While university is undoubtedly a place of incredible learning opportunities, delving deep into the theory on which engineering is built, this depth of learning is unfortunately not matched by breadth. There appears to be an entire spectrum of employability that is absent from the university curriculum, a void which I hope to traverse with the help of SLP. Additionally, I believe there exists significant overlap between the aforementioned employability and personal development. Networking, presentations and personal branding can all be distilled into fundamental interpersonal skills, skills I hope to master for personal and professional use. ","The previously mentioned disconnect represents not the absence of a job or internship, but more fundamentally, an absence of skills. In order to bridge this gap, there are several defined skills I wish to develop, with networking at its centre. In an immediate sense, the development of networking skills would assist greatly in the search for internships, a critical part of my progression toward a professional career. More than this however, I believe networking skill reflects a more fundamental interpersonal skill that can be applied long after an internship has been found. It represents an ability to connect with people that I am confident will prove crucial throughout my professional career and indeed in my personal life. On a more abstract note, something I want to take away from SLP is not a concrete skill per se, but rather exposure – exposure to the professional environment through the collaboration with industry. First-hand experience is always the best teacher.","Teamwork is one of reasons I am passionate about engineering. I truly enjoy the collaborative spirit, the unification of efforts to complete a common goal, unattainable to any single individual. I genuinely believe that I perform well in a team. Separate from the engineering experience, I believe my best example of teamwork manifests every night at my part-time job at Woolworths. While replenishing shelves is ostensibly a fairly simple job, it is ultimately predicated on the cohesive functioning of the team to finish on time. A major part of this cohesion is communication and adaptability. Thus, I attempt to maintain a consistent dialogue with both superiors and team mates. This communication enables me to quickly respond to other team members if they are struggling, while managing my own delegated task, keeping the common goal in focus. ","The word “leadership” is used frequently to say the least. Something of a buzzword at times, any clear definition of the word has been blurred over the years. Or perhaps, the concept itself is so incredibly abstract and varied that no single definition exists. Regardless, leadership as a concept is something that appears to me viscerally more than anything. While difficult to define, I seem to know it when I see it. In recent times, this has manifested most prominently within the various group projects at university. In the groups where such a “leader” has emerged, there is a sense of clarity moving forward. Deadlines are meaningful and all contributions are considered equally lending to a far superior outcome and learning experience. In the absence of this leader, the opposite: tasks are left to the last minute, with no clear roles between the group members. While vague, this is thus far my clearest interpretation of leadership. There are times where I feel like I was that leader, but could not pinpoint the genesis of the position, nor why it manifested then, but not in other groups. In undertaking SLP, I hope to clarify the concept of leadership by further exposing myself to leaders in the industry and equipping myself with the skills they possess.",www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-lim-b36363154
5/4/2018 22:50:56,Jana Giang,j.giang@unsw.edu.au,451426486,3,UNSW,Bachelor of Mechanical/ Masters of Biomedical ,Mechanical Engineering,Friend,"I believe that the STEM Leaders Program will be able to provide me with the skills to successfully apply for a job and gain more experience. As a 3rd year student who has had little to no experience in regards to networking and industry, I’ve been actively looking for an opportunity to be able to improve in a comprehensive range of professional development skills. I feel that the STEM Leaders Program would provide me with this all within a short time frame, allowing me to get on track with my peers in regards to professional skills. Further, I really appreciate the idea that this program aims to prepare us for the workplace as this is not necessarily achieved or addressing in our classroom learning at the university. ","Although my goal is to gain as much knowledge and skills as possible, there are several specific skills that I would value more at this time. As someone that is not naturally inclined to reach out to others or particularly outspoken, I seek to improve my skills in this area – namely, networking and presentation skills. From this program, I wish to be able to improve my confidence and communication skills as well as become a more active participant in all areas. I also wish to greatly improve my resume writing skills and get feedback so I can successful apply for internships and jobs, which is ultimately the goal of this program for me. In terms of career development, I am clearly still in the beginning stages. I believe that the skills from this program would provide me with the platform to establish my career.","In regards to teamwork, I have always been a strong contributor but that is not the only component that is important for a successful team. In the second year course, MMAN2130, we were required to work in a team in order to produce a working air pump and accompanying. In order for this task to be completed on time, everyone had to contribute a fair amount of time and work in manufacturing. In addition, there also had to be clear communication between group members especially when completing the report. As I was responsible for assembling and editing the report, tasks were delegated, but within a report, distinctions between sections are not necessarily so clear. As a result, this required constant communication and information to be relayed between group members as I edited each part – this included ensuring that information wasn’t redundant and there weren’t any issues left unaddressed. This allowed us to submit a cohesive report.","I was previously involved in a social change project during high school. The project focused on raising awareness about global primary education. As such a large group of students, around 30, there was an obvious lack of direction and progress within the beginning stages of the project – thus leaving us in a stalemate. I believe that it is particularly important within teams that members possess the intuition and adaptability to recognise that sometimes the team may require more ‘leaders’ or more ‘followers’. In our situation, it was not helpful that many were pitching ideas. And with an obvious lack of ‘followers’ to carry out any action, no progress was made. To resolve this issue, the team was reorganised into sub divisions each with an individual leader who all in turn supported the general team leader. This really allowed us to advance well into the project. As the leader of the group responsible for sponsorships, we were able to efficiently set tasks with more specificity – including a time frame and the precise amounts required. We were able to successfully get sponsored with over 800 brochures and 30 t-shirts which all contributed to raising the awareness of our campaign.

I also want to develop my leadership and presenting skills and this program sounded like the perfect way to do so!","I'm particularly interested in developing my leadership and presenting skills, as I currently have limited experience with both of these, and a great desire to learn! Having more experience working in a team and building on my (fairly substantial) teamwork and communication skills is another aspect of the program that I am excited about.","In a sumobot project I'm working on with two teammates, I think we worked well as a team. We were able to discuss design ideas and draw these out to make them clearer, while listening to each other. I proposed a risky design concept with a flipping mechanism similar to a catapult to potentially flip over and move our opponents away. We talked about it and decided to go with a simpler design that could have the flipping mechanism attached to it. We were able to make a prototype for the mechanism and are now working on finishing the body of the robot for further experimentation. I think this was successful teamwork as I contributed to the team and also listened to my peers and their ideas; leading to a flexible design that is both safe and innovative.","I'm currently a team leader for a pump project for my MMAN2130 course. I created a group chat after meeting my team members and encouraged everyone to participate in group discussions about our design, often offering ideas and ensuring that our design met the design specifications we were given as well as finalising decisions about dimensions etc.. I then also took initiative and 3D printed a prototype for the valve in our design. I helped some team members with designing their components on Solidworks and purchased some of the materials we would need to help us make the pump, as we will begin shortly, prepared for the task thanks to everyone's contribution and collaboration.",www.linkedin.com/in/anitasmirnov/

One of my long term personal goals has been to improve my leadership abilities, not only for my career but also as a personal endeavour. In addition, learning from the leading experts in industry gives the Stem Leaders students an opportunity of a lifetime. Furthermore, understanding about how the workforce operates at leading engineering companies is highly advantageous and being able to see it first hand at an early age is an opportunity that cannot be missed. Better improving my personal endeavours and being able to witness first hand how an engineering company operates drives my desire to be part of the Stem Leaders Program. ","After completion of the Stem Leaders Program, being able to develop on organisational skills, ability to efficiently delegate and handle responsibility in a calm respectable manner. I believe these skills are fundamental to any career, especially that of a leader. A leader with these skills not only creates a good working environment for themselves, but also is able to provide a more meaningful environment for the employees. Hence I believe gaining these attributes in a highly competitive and fast paced industry is invaluable and something I wish to strive for and attain to the best of my capability by the completion of the Program. ","Being part of a team is something that excites me. Surrounded by like minded individuals who strive to develop something extraordinary, coupled with creative and innovative ideas. I was able to experience this at PCYC sports club where I was able to work with a group of highly motivated and driven employees and employers. I was designated to complete schedules for Boxing, where I had to communicate with boxers and other staff members to make a suitable timetable to suit all the parties involved. This resulted in a very cohesive and successful timetable layout which is currently being used at the sports club. In addition to this I was required to manage the front reception area, registration, hiring of courts and equipment and finally attending customer request over the counter or through the phone. In doing so I was able to have a more developed understanding on my communicational and organisational skills, thus making a more well-rounded leader and most importantly a better team member. ","Being an ambitious undergraduate student, I took on the responsibilty of being a team leader of a university lead project where I was able to delegate multiple tasks out to the other members. The objective of the assignment was to create an autonomous vehicle, through which the groups had to research, design and build a highly efficient self-powering vehicle being able manoeuvre past obstacles all by itself without any human interaction. However, in doing so I was quickly able to sense the disparity between members in their English ability. This was a difficult situation to handle as communication was not effective between members and the quality of work was not up to my standard. Due to this I took the initiative to set up pairs, where more English proficient students were teamed up with the less proficient. In addition, by splitting the group of 5 into three small teams, we were able to effectively split the responsibility of the assignment. By doing so the less proficient English speakers were able to learn, and gain support from their partner but also was able to have a deeper understanding and engagement of the tasks ahead. By doing this we were able to follow a more efficient procedure. In addition, all the members were able to enjoy and contribute to the project which resulted in us gaining the highest mark. Through this experience I was able to understand the role of a leader, by ensuring the team is consistently motivated and producing the highest standard of work possible from each individual member.  Furthermore, I was able to push my boundaries by taking extra responsibilities, and further was able to witness the impacts of my decisions on each individual.

The idea of working on a real engineering project and having the opportunity to pitch our solution to an industry panel sounds exciting, and a great way to get hands on experience in my field of engineering (which is electrical) and get a taste of engineering and the skills needed in the real workforce. I would love to step out of the comfort of the classroom and challenge myself to develop and learn new skills, as well as meet a range of amazing and like minded individuals in this unforgettable experience!","Technically, as I have never worked on a real engineering project before, I would love to learn more about the engineering processes and how to apply to technical skills I learnt in the classroom to our project. Of course, there will always be technical knowledge I won't know so I would also love to facilitate my own learning and gain greater insight into the technical skills required in the workforce. 

In terms of soft skills, although I am usually an effective and confident communicator, I would like more experience communicating and presenting in a formal industry setting. Finally, I would love to gain more experience working with a diverse group of other like minded and passionate individuals. Every team is different and I will undoubtedly learn so much about communicating and teamwork! ","In my experience of organising an industry workshop and networking BBQ with Accenture with a small team last year, I was able to contribute positively to a successful event. I was able to offer new ideas and designs as I took responsibility for organising the rooms and setup, as well as the gifts and thank you cards for the Accenture representatives. During the event itself, I made sure I was there the entire event so I could keep an eye out for the other teammates and offer support. I made sure I spoke out when I had questions and was not afraid to ask for help. As a result, I believe my ability to communicate and act as a support to my team during the planning and running of our workshop contributed to its success, and serves as an example of a time I performed well as a teammate.","Overall, I believe a leader is someone who is not only able to do things themselves, but also empowers others to do the same, or even better. In my time working at CodeCamp during the Summer, I was able to both witness and act as a leader myself. 

As a Teaching Assistant, I acted as a support to the Head Teacher, who led a group of ~20 primary school students, teaching them coding concepts and how to build their own game app. In this role, I observed the way the Head Teacher was able to use his skills and knowledge to inspire the students and encourage them to be excited and interested about coding. He supported class participation and encouraged the students who making their own games, outside to those that were outlined in the teaching plan. Through observing the way this Head Teacher used his skills to enpower and inspire the students, I was able to act as a leader when my role changed to a Head Teacher. 

As a Head Teacher, I made sure I was someone who used my technical understanding to help my students do more. Although at first I was apprehensive about allowing students to deviate slightly from the teaching plan, I soon realised that encouraging the students to be creative with the skills I taught them was ultimately more rewarding. I made sure I was able to teach all the essential skills, as well as give my students the freedom to use these skills for their own ideas. I believe I acted as an effective leader as Head Teacher as at the end of CodeCamp, my students had an extremely positive experience, were genuinely interested about coding and were all so proud of the games they had built themselves, from scratch.

Electrical Engineering/Commerce,Electrical Engineering,Friend,"I decided to apply for the STEM Leader's Program because of the structure and environment it provides. By culminating individuals with a similar drive to improve our collaborative skills, while challenging us to work to solve tasks from a real-world context, the Program appeals to qualities that I am seeking to develop in myself. Additionally, I am compelled to bring my own experiences and opinions to the table in order to also ensure that my colleagues gain their own benefits from my contributions. Given the wide variety of backgrounds that this Program is sure to attract, there is no doubt that the cumulative contribution provided by each participant is an experience that I wish to be a part of.","From my understanding, the Program serves to benefit students who are looking to improve their presentation and speaking abilities by addressing cases, based on real world industries, in a regularly timely fashion. Additionally, it drives them to work with a team to deliver proficient results and solutions for clients relevant to the chosen industry, and to hone in on traits that would allow an individual to thrive in STEM fields.
Taking this into consideration, I would like to benefit from the encouragement that the program gives its participants to test themselves in an unfamiliar environment with others of diverse educational and experiential backgrounds.","I feel that I perform well in teams, with a strong ability to perceive potential issues in the project management aspect for the team. Recently I was involved in a group task for a course that required a group presentation to be made in front of my peers. Despite having a presentation date set many weeks into the future, I determined that it was necessary to establish milestones at set time intervals, given the increasing workload that each team member would start to be given. Doing so also allowed for us to have ample preparation time for practising the actual presentation before the actual date. It was through these efforts that I effectively mitigated any delays caused by members not accomplishing their tasks on time. As such, I believe that I worked well with my team during the circumstance in order to successfully achieve our goal.","During my first year of university, I was working on a team-based project for a course. Despite supposedly setting up ample time to finish construction on the final design for our presentation, my group and I found ourselves unable to meet our deadline due to lacking efforts from certain members of the team. I reasoned that they would not be able to effectively contribute until some action was taken. Having had a firm grasp on the goals of the project, I set aside time to talk to them individually to see if any issues were present. It became increasingly evident that a poor division of task loads resulted in them feeling overwhelmed and unable to focus on one priority feature; I later surmised that this had stemmed from a lack of proficiency in my delegation of workloads to each member. As a result, I discussed with the rest of the team compromises that could be made in order to mitigate this, and, by allowing work to be handled by those who were more comfortable in those areas, we were able to overcome the halt and deliver a polished result that yielded favourable marks for all of us. Ultimately, the change in attitudes of my team mates, from initially apparent apathy to later jubilation at our success, convinced me that I had positively impacted them during our time as a team.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-lim/

These industries have significantly contributed to development and innovation in areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and will continue to do so in the future. This has inspired me to study a related degree, particularly technology being of interest to me. There are a growing number of career prospects associated with STEM, making it crucial for me to be aware of how these industries collaborate and be alert of the jobs that would be demanded in the future. I am keen to learn the valuable skills that this program will offer and explore STEM further. I am very passionate about learning in all aspects whether that be through my academic endeavours or leadership and team work skills.","Although there are many skills offered, leadership, problem-solving, proactive and teamwork skills stand out to me the most. I believe these skills are key in any industry that STEM promotes. Leadership skills are instrumental in distinguishing those who can be leaders. I would love to seek this opportunity to build upon my leadership skills not only as a means of differentiation but also to develop the characteristics of a great role model. In addition to this, problem solving is a desired skill to possess particularly in the STEM industries with demand for constant critical thinking and proposing solutions to endless problems. This can be supplemented with proactive skills which are highly beneficial in taking initiative and responding to problems. This program can help me sharpen my proactive skills and take commitments. Lastly, teamwork skills hold great importance in any industry requiring members to collaborate efforts and strengthen communication. ","I have strong interpersonal skills and enjoy working with others. The STEM Leaders Program provides an opportunity to meet others and work as a team. I am part of the Marketing Subcommittee of Amnesty International UNSW. As part of this, working as a team allows us to share our ideas and opinions on how we should raise awareness on the issues that Amnesty deals with. In addition, working in a team has allowed to share our skills, and according to this we base our decisions. For example, one person who is knowledgeable about the digital aspect of marketing can demonstrate their expertise while the others focus on their own strengths. This has allowed me to improve time management skills and be more productive by sharing roles. Through this experience, I have been able learn from and with others to reach common objectives and collaborate efforts. ","I have recently completed an internship at a recruitment firm over the summer break. During this experience I have been able to work with other business professionals who have been a role model to me in many ways. This practical exposure of a work environment has made me realise the importance of leadership skills. For example, allowing me observe how they combat problems that arise and reach a common consensus while taking into account everyone’s views has taught me to also approach such a method when working in a team for Amnesty. With my recent experience, I am willing to contribute my skills and learn more through a team environment. As part of this, working as a team allows us to share our ideas and opinions on how we should raise awareness on the issues that Amnesty deals with and really be able to reach out to the public. Through such valuable experiences, I have not only observed practical application of leaderships skills but also been able to apply it myself. I am driven and committed to any task that I do, ensuring I give my best effort. I believe the STEM Leaders Program will provide me an opportunity to demonstrate these skills and build upon them whilst learning at the same time. This will really help me learn and develop my skills to become a future STEM leader. ","https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhriti-narsey/
